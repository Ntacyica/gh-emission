These are to take the same carbon tax policy as the United States (that is $40 per ton of carbon tariffs) and differentiated tax policy (that is, the “common but differentiated responsibilities” and product competitiveness point of view, US imposes a $40 per ton carbon tax on domestic products, while China imposes a $9 per ton tax on domestic products). Setting four specific policy scenarios (the United States takes a carbon tax collection only on products that are produced from their own country; the United States imposes a carbon tax both on domestic products and on products exported from China; China and the United States adopt the same carbon tax policy for their own domestic products; and China and the United States adopt differentiated carbon tax policies for their own domestic products), this study uses an Energy-Environmental Version of the Global Trade Analysis Project model (GTAP-E) to explore whether China's active emission reduction can be an effective choice to deal with the US carbon tariff threat. The results of the research showed a 1.4% fall in China's GDP resulting from a $40 per ton of carbon tariff on Chinese products although such move by China is to avoid carbon tariffs on China's exports to the United States. This adverse economic effects thus makes this method an ineffective way of dealing with the threats. When China imposes a carbon tax of $9 per ton on domestic products, China's real GDP and residents' welfare decline but are effectively controlled, and the world's total carbon dioxide emissions also reduce considerably. Therefore, in this way, China can effectively deal with the threat of US carbon tariffs. This paper applies the GTAP-E model to refine the research different from existing research on model building. It analyzes the change of China's economy, carbon dioxide, and industry output and import under the different situations. This will help take reasonable measures in our country when dealing with the carbon tariffs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Carbon tariff; Differentiated carbon tax policy; GTAP-E model; Low carbon economy; Sino-US trade","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Emission control; Global warming; Renewable energy resources; Taxation; Carbon emissions; Carbon tariffs; Carbon taxes; E-Model; Low carbon economy; Economic analysis","Bao, Q., Tang, L., Yang, L.X., The Impact of US Carbon Tariffs on China: an Analysis Based on the Computable General Equilibrium Model (2010), 22, pp. 25-33. , Low-carbon Economy and China's Development; Bao, Q., Tang, L., Wang, S.Y., Qiao, H., What is the impact of US carbon tariffs on China's economy?

We develop a dynamic CGE model for Spain to assess the economic and environmental effects of a carbon tax, and test the double dividend (DD) hypothesis. We simulate the impact of three carbon taxes: €10, €20 and €30 per ton of CO2. For each tax, four ‘revenue recycling’ scenarios are examined: a reduction of taxes on capital, on labor, on value-added tax, and a scenario in which revenues are not recycled. We find a DD for taxes of €10/ton and lower, within five to seven years of implementation. We estimate an annual CO2 emissions reduction of around 10% with this tax. Under some circumstances, the DD can be achieved for a tax of €20/ton. In any case, recycling revenues to cut pre-existing taxes reduces costs of imposing carbon taxes. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

As one of the most important incentive-based policy instruments, carbon tax has sparked a lively controversy in China. This paper explores the impact of carbon tax on Chinese economy, as well as the cushion effects of the complementary policies, by constructing a dynamic recursive general equilibrium model. The model can describe the new equilibrium for each sequential independent period (e.g. one year) after carbon tax and the complementary policies are imposed, and thus describe the long-term impacts of the policies. The simulation results show that carbon tax is an effective policy tool because it can reduce carbon emissions with a little negative impact on economic growth; reducing indirect tax in the meantime of imposing carbon tax will help to reduce the negative impact of the tax on production and competitiveness; in addition, giving households subsidy in the meantime will help to stimulate household consumptions. Therefore, complementary policies used together with carbon tax will help to cushion the negative impacts of carbon tax on the economy. The dynamic CGE analysis shows the impact of carbon tax policy on the GDP is relatively small, but the reduction of carbon emission is relatively large. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon tax; China; Complementary policy","Carbon emissions; Carbon taxes; China; Chinese economy; Chinese Government; Complementary policy; Domestic energy; Economic growths; General equilibrium models; Negative impacts; Policy instruments; Policy tools; Simulation result; Competition; Dynamic analysis; Economics; Emission control; Global warming; Taxation; carbon emission; computable general equilibrium analysis; economic impact; energy policy; global warming; pollution tax; China","Chen, H., Zhang, L., Thoughts about the feasibility of using carbon tax to reduce greenhouse gases emissions (2009) Finance Forum, 1, pp. 35-40; (2000) Chinese Study of Climate Change, , Tsinghua Publication, Beijing, The Chinese Study Group of Climate Change; Gao, P., Chen, W., Carbon tax and carbon emissions (2002) Tsinghua Science and Technology, 10, pp. 1335-1338; Govinda, R., (2007), Timilsina, The role of revenue recycling schemes in environmental tax selection: a general equilibrium analysis.

Companies adjust their output and the proportion of carbon emissions to maximize profits.And through numerical analysis, we find that: When the Government set up the target emission,it will encourage companies to invest carbon emissionsabatement, and enable companies to reduce carbon emissions.And then the Government may reduce the rate of carbon tax. Finally, Government and companiescan get win-win situation.In the Cournot duopoly market, Abatement Company has more advantage in the competition of the market and more sustainableunder the constraint of carbon tax.

The results show that carbon taxation can effectively reduce the national GHG emissions. In the scenario of imposing the carbon tax only on coal consumption, the economy tends to improve better than imposing the tax on all types of fossil fuels. This finding indicates that the policy could only reduce the total production cost of electricity supply, but cannot offset the increased price of fossil fuels due to carbon tax. Our analysis also shows that a revenue-recycling scheme of carbon tax on coal uses by reducing the electricity price will lead to welfare improvements and inequality reductions since coal is only consumed in the industrial sector. © 2021 Franco Angeli Edizioni.

Based on this model, the government's optimal carbon-emission tax scheme and the company's optimal transportation mode and production decisions are explored. We find that: 1) whether or not the transport carbon-emission tax can increase social welfare depends on the relationships among the social cost of carbon (SCC), the transportation mode shifting threshold (TMST), and the biggest carbon-emission tax that a company can afford (BCRA); 2) a greater SCC implies a higher probability of improving social welfare via imposing transportation carbon-emission tax; and 3) a smaller TMST or BCRA yields a higher probability of improving social welfare when a carbon-emission tax is imposed. Further study shows that imposing a carbon-emission tax on the product with a higher production cost, a bigger product volume, or a bigger product density can increase the probability of improving social welfare. © 2015 IEEE.","Carbon-emission tax; economic systems; social welfare; supply chain management; sustainability; Transportation mode selection","Probability; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; Taxation; Carbon emissions; Economic system; Optimal transportations; Product density; Production decisions; Social cost of carbon; Social welfare; Transportation mode; Transportation","De Albuquerque, G.A., Maciel, P., Lima, R.M.F., Magnani, F., Strategic and tactical evaluation of conflicting environment and business goals in green supply chains (2013) IEEE Trans.

As a foture-coming choice, carbon tax earns close attention and will be implemented in the near foture. This study shows the changes to the energy mix by imposing carbon tax and the relative mitigation effects, as well as mitigation costs, applying a linear bottom-up optimization programming model (BOMCES).

The primary objective of the South African government in imposing carbon tax is to reduce greenhouse gase emissions (GHG) and address the environmental dimension of sustainability. Amongst the policy' expectations are firstly pricing mechanisms on the environmental and economic damages caused by excessive emissions of GHG. Secondly, the policy aims to drive further investment in green technology projects thereby creating jobs and alleviating poverty in the country. The study will demonstrate that, despite government's good intention in reducing GHG emissions, its subsequent impacts on different sectors of the economy particularly the mining industry is still uncertain. Conversely, the business's view is that carbon tax will inflict destructive socio-economic implications across emitting industries including the mining industry. There is still uncertainty that carbon tax will achieve environmental objectives and succeed to put much emphasis on the prevention of further pollution to the environment in which businesses operate. The government put emphasis on the preservation of environment on one side, the industry on the other side prefers to salvage the socio-economic in lieu of environmental consideration. The investment in renewable technologies expected to create jobs and alleviate poverty is yet to overcome challenges pertaining to the cost involved in repairing the environmental damages caused by the carbon emissions. Although carbon taxation was designed to promote environmental sustainability, however its implementation in the mining industry may not lead to economic and social sustainability. Sustainable development is an integrated theory structured in three dimensions namely the economic, social and environmental aspects. A policy instrument which is effective in one dimension but detrimental to the other dimensions may be an ineffective choice when considering sustainable development as a whole. If the carbon tax as an instrument is to be considered effective it has to be sustainable from an environmental, economic and social perspectives. In this study, an overview of sustainable development and carbon tax challenges is presented from literature data gathered through books, journals, scientific papers, academic conferences and other relevant publication channels. The literature review will be applied as an approach to develop the topic in an integrated way such that new perspectives and ways of addressing sustainable development and carbon tax challenges would be generated. A three-pronged approach encompassing environmental, economic and social review will be used in discussing and validating the sustainability challenges of carbon tax on South African mining industry.

The recently proposed carbon regulation in international shipping will not only affect the competitiveness of shipping lines, but will also have implications for the global economy. This paper adopts an energy-environmental version of the Global Trade Analysis Project referred to as GTAP-E to analyze the quantitative effects of a maritime carbon tax on the global economy by placing a special focus on containerizable commodities given their significant role in international trade. The major advantage of the GTAP-E model is that it can capture the effects of asymmetric changes in freight costs on different routes caused by the maritime carbon tax. Based on our numerical results, imposing a maritime carbon tax on international container shipping will not lead to a significant economic impact unless the tax level is high. China will suffer the greatest real GDP loss among all countries. Under a high level of global maritime carbon tax ($90/tCO2), the real GDP loss to China will be around 0.02%. The negative economic impacts on the European countries will be greater if a maritime carbon tax is imposed only on the European container exporting/importing routes, compared to the situation where a global maritime carbon tax is imposed on container shipping. Finally, the imposition of a maritime carbon tax will discourage distant container trade on the routes (origin-destination) ""China-USA"", ""Rest of Asia-USA"", and ""South America-China"". © 2013.","Computable general equilibrium model; Economy-wide impact analysis; Global Trade Analysis Project; Maritime carbon tax","Carbon taxes; Computable general equilibrium model; Container shippings; European Countries; Global trade; Impact analysis; International shippings; Quantitative effects; Containers; International trade; Ships; Economic and social effects; competitiveness; computable general equilibrium analysis; container ship; economic impact; export; global economy; global trade; Gross Domestic Product; import; international trade; pollution tax; shipping; China; Europe; United States","Abrell, J., Regulating CO2 emissions of transportation in Europe: a CGE-analysis using market-based instruments (2010) Transportation Research Part D, 15, pp. 235-239; Anger, A., Including aviation in the European emissions trading scheme: impacts on the industry, CO2 emissions and macroeconomic activity in the EU (2010) Journal of Air Transport Management, 16, pp. 100-105; Anger, A., Barker, T., Pollitt, H., Lindstad, H., Eyring, V., Lee, D.S., (2009) International Shipping and Market Based Instruments 2009, , International Maritime Organization, London; Ariyasajjakorn, D., Gander, J., Ratanakomut, S., Reynolds, S., ASEAN FTA, distribution of income, and globalization (2009) Journal of Asian Economics, 20, pp. 327-335; Armington, P.A., A theory of demand for products distinguished by place of production (1969) IMF Staff Papers, 16, pp. 159-178; Bode, S., Isensee, J., Krause, K., Michaelowa, A., Climate policy: analysis of ecological, technical and economic implications for international maritime transport (2002) International Journal of Maritime Economics, 4 (2), pp. 164-184; Boon, B., Davidson, M., Faber, J., van Velzen, A., (2007), Allocation of Allowances for Aviation in the EU ETS: The Impact on the Profitability of the Aviation Sector under High Levels of Auctioning.

Many studies have indicated the probablity of such a tax entailing substantial economic costs. However, such studies have not tended to take into account the possible positive effects of using carbon tax revenues to reduce distortionary taxes elsewhere in the economy or to offset competitiveness effects, or of the possibility that a carbon tax will stimulate innovation and efficiency in the energy sector, with positive economic results. The paper concludes that when these factors are given due weight imposing a carbon tax is more likely to entail economic benefit than cost. © 1994.","Carbon tax; CO2 abatement; Environmental policy","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Competition; Costs; Economic and social effects; Energy policy; Environmental engineering; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Mathematical models; Carbon dioxide abatement; Carbon tax; Environmental policy; Macroeconomic impact; Revenues; Taxation; carbon tax; economic impact; environmental economics; pollution control; UK","Cline, The scientific basis of the greenhouse effect (1991) The Economic Journal, 101, pp. 904-919; Pearce, The role of carbon taxes in adjusting to global warming (1991) The Economic Journal, 101, pp. 938-948; Boero, Clarke, Winters, (1991) The Macroeconomic Consequences of Controlling Greenhouse Gases: a Survey, , Department of the Environment, HMSO, London; Hoeller, Dean, Nicolaisen, Macroeconomic Implications of Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions: A Survey of Empirical Studies (1991) OECD Economic Studies, (16), pp. 46-78; Nordhaus, The cost of slowing climate change a survey (1991) The Energy Journal, 12 (1); (1992) The Economics of Global Warming, , Washington DC; Dean, Hoeller, Costs of Reducing CO2 Emissions: Evidence from Six Global Models (1992) OECD Economic Studies No 19, pp. 16-47; Boero, Clarke, Winters, (1991) The Macroeconomic Consequences of Controlling Greenhouse Gases: a Survey, , Department of the Environment, HMSO, London; Boero, Clarke, Winters, (1991) The Macroeconomic Consequences of Controlling Greenhouse Gases: a Survey, pp. 87-89. , See Table 5, Department of the Environment, HMSO, London; Pezzey, (1991) Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Control Strategies on UK Competitiveness, p. 108. , One ton of oil emits 0.88 t of carbon, Department of Trade and Industry, HMSO, London, A tax of US$250 per ton of carbon is therefore US$220 per ton of oil or US$217 per tonne of oil (1 ton = 1.016 tonne). 1 tonne is 7.5 barrels, so US$217 per tonne is US$29 per barrel or US$0.69 per US gallon of petrol (1 barrel = 42 US gal = 35 UK gal = 159 litres), ignoring differences in carbon content between petrol and crude oil.

We develop a multi-region model of tax competition and resource extraction to assess the fiscal incentive of imposing a tax on carbon rather than on capital. We explicitly model international capital and resource markets, as well as intertemporal capital accumulation and resource extraction. While fossil resources give rise to scarcity rents, capital does not. With carbon taxes, the rents can be captured and invested in infrastructure, which leads to higher welfare than under capital taxation. This result holds even without modeling environmental damages. It is robust under a variation of the behavioral assumptions of resource importers to coordinate their actions, and a resource exporter’s ability to counteract carbon policies. Further, no green paradox occurs—instead, the carbon tax constitutes a viable green policy, since it postpones extraction and reduces cumulative emissions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Carbon pricing; Green paradox; Infrastructure; Optimal taxation; Strategic instrument choice; Supply-side dynamics; Tax competition","Carbon; Climate change; Economics; Extraction; Investments; Carbon pricing; Green paradoxes; Infrastructure; Instrument choices; Optimal taxation; Supply sides; Taxation; administrative system; capital market; climate change; infrastructure; optimization; pollution tax; pricing policy; resource economy; resource use; sustainability; tax incentive","Allen, R., (1938) Mathematical analysis for economists, , Macmillan and Co, London; Amundsen, E.S., Schöb, R., Environmental taxes on exhaustible resources (1999) Eur J Polit Econ, 15, pp. 311-329; Anthoff, D., Tol, R., The impact of climate change on the balanced growth equivalent: an application of FUND (2009) Environ Resour Econ, 34, pp. 351-367; Babiker, M.H., Subglobal climate-change actions and carbon leakage: the implication of international capital flows (2001) Energy Econ, 23, pp. 121-139; Baier, S.L., Glomm, G., Long-run growth and welfare effects of public policies with distortionary taxation (2001) J Econ Dyn Control, 25, pp. 2007-2042; U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (2013) fixed assets accounts tables, , http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=10&step=1#reqid=10&step=1&isuri=1; Benassy-Quere, A., Gobalraja, N., Trannoy, A., Tax and public input competition (2007) Econ Policy, 22, pp. 385-430; Bento, A.M., Jacobsen, M., Ricardian rents, environmental policy and the ‘double-dividend’ hypothesis (2007) J Environ Econ Manag, 53, pp. 17-31; Bom, P., Ligthart, J., What have we learned from three decades of research on the productivity of public capital?

Six policy scenarios explore two overarching issues: (1) the effects of a carbon tax under alternative assumptions about the use of the resulting revenue, and (2) the effects of alternative revenue sources to reduce the budget deficit. We examine a simple excise tax on the carbon content of fossil fuels in the U.S. energy sector starting immediately at $15 per ton of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and rising at 4 percent above inflation each year. We investigate policies that allow the revenue from the illustrative carbon tax to reduce the long-run federal budget deficit or the marginal tax rates on labor and capital income. We also compare imposing a carbon tax to increasing rates of other taxes to reduce the deficit by the same amount. We find that within 25 years of adopting the carbon tax, annual CO2 emissions are 20 percent lower than baseline levels. We find that using the revenue for a capital tax cut is significantly different than other revenue recycling policies. In that case, investment rises, employment and wages rise, and overall GDP is significantly above its baseline level through year 25. Thus, adopting a carbon tax and using the revenue to reduce capital taxes would achieve the dual goals of reducing CO2 emissions significantly and expanding employment and the economy.","Carbon tax; Fiscal policy; General equilibrium",,"Barro, R., Are government bonds net wealth?

Carbon taxes are not currently used to any significant extent, but they provide one of the simplest methods of internalizing the costs of emission of greenhouse gases. After a survey of their current use, their design is discussed. Carbon taxes should be set equal to the marginal harm from a unit of emissions for each type of GHG. By imposing them upstream on extraction or refining of fossil fuels, all emissions from fossil fuels can be covered by a tax imposed on relatively few entities. Including other sources of emissions, such as deforestation or farming, would be more complex but, in many cases, it would be feasible. The distribution of carbon taxes when considering only the uses of carbon emissions is regressive, but once their effect on factor prices is considered, carbon taxes may be progressive. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This paper develops a game model to analyze pricing decisions of a remanufacturing supply chain under the constraint of the carbon tax policy. Meanwhile, we analyze the impacts of the carbon tax on optimal prices and production quantity of new (remanufactured) products, the profits for the manufacturer and remanufacturer, total carbon emissions and the remanufacturing rate. In addition, we analyze the impacts of the carbon tax on the equilibrium results by using numerical studies. Such analytical results throw clear insights in to the role of consumer's willingness-to-pay for the remanufactured product. It is hoped that all these conclusions and managerial implications may provide reference for the manufacturer and remanufacturer to optimize decisions under the carbon tax policy, and provide some theoretical basis for the government to adjust and design incentive policies. © 2018 IEEE.","carbon emissions;

Microgrids could come into play to aid the network through CO2 emission reduction while increasing their efficiency through local generation. For this purpose, a Smart Microgrid incorporating Distributed Energy Resources (DER), especially Renewable Energy Sources (RES), is operated optimally while keeping the CO2 emissions in check in order to minimize the financial burden from emissions stemming from the carbon tax. Since the network is assumed to be interconnected with the main grid, there is a consideration of the expected emissions associated with the imported energy. Design/methodology/approach: An economic/environmental dispatch problem is mathematically formulated using an objective function and the constraints that it is subject to. The methodology is applied on a typical 17-bus test distribution network, representing a Hellenic LV network. Various carbon tax rates and their impact on the system marginal price are examined, in terms of their effect on distributed generation (DG) and as a second step, the effect of imposing lower carbon tax rates for micro-sources with the goal of benefitting from their more eco-friendly generation capabilities. In order to assess that benefit, hourly grid emissions coefficients are derived based on actual grid data. Findings: The CO2 tax refund policy towards the DG owners can lead to optimal coverage of consumers, optimal financial result both for the DG owners and the operator and greater DG integration within the smart grid. Originality/value: Greater DG integration within the smart grid by using a CO2 tax refund policy. © 2018, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Carbon tax; Distributed energy resources; Environmental dispatch; Renewable energy sources; Smart Microgrid; System marginal price",,"Anastasiadis, A.G., Konstantinopoulos, S.A., Kondylis, G.P., Vokas, G.A., Papageorgas, G.P., Effect of fuel cell units in economic and environmental dispatch of a microgrid with penetration of photovoltaic and micro turbine units (2016) International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 42 (5), pp. 3479-3486; Farhangi, H., The path of the smart grid (2010) IEEE Power and Energy Magazine, 8 (1), pp. 18-28; Hatziargyriou, N., Dimeas, A., Tsikalakis, A., Centralized and decentralized control of microgrids (2005) International Journal of Distributed Energy Resources, 1 (3), pp. 197-212; Hatziargyriou, N.D., Anastasiadis, A.G., Vasiljevska, J., Tsikalakis, A.G., (2009) Quantification of economic, environmental and operational benefits of microgrids, , IEEE PowerTech 2009, Bucharest; Hatziargyriou, N.D., Anastasiadis, A.G., Vasiljevska, J., Tsikalakis, A.G., Quantification of economic, environmental and operational benefits due to significant penetration of microgrids in a typical LV and MV Greek network (2011) European Transactions on Electrical Power, 21 (2), pp. 1217-1237; www.admie.gr/leitoyrgia-dedomena/leitoyrgia-systimatos/dedomena-pragmatikoy-chronoy/anafores/; Klessmann, C., Held, A., Rathmann, M., Ragwitz, M., Status and perspectives of renewable energy policy and deployment in the European Union-what is needed to reach the 2020 targets?

We find that by imposing a tax of £50 per tonne of CO2 the 37% CO2 reduction target is met with a very rapid adjustment in all three cases if the model incorporates forward-looking behaviour. However, the adjustment is much slower if agents are myopic. In addition, the results of the model suggest that a carbon tax might simultaneously stimulate economic activity whilst reducing emissions and thus secure a double dividend, but only for the case in which the revenue is recycled through income tax. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon tax; CGE modelling; Double dividend; Regional economics",,"Adams, P.D., Parmenter, B.R., Computable General Equilibrium Modelling of Environmental Issues in Australia: Economic Impacts of an Emissions Trading Scheme (2013) Handbook of Computable General Equilibrium Modeling, , 1A and 1B, (SET), P.B.

Imposing carbon taxes to mitigate the emissions from the electricity sector is a well-established method to counteract the detrimental effects of CO 2 on the environment. This added tax, however, has a negative impact on the economy and wholesale electricity prices. A fact that is more evident when regulating authorities set higher reduction targets which require a higher tax rate. This paper proposes a framework in which regulating authorities can use the revenue from the levied taxes to subsidize more expensive producers that have lower CO 2 emissions, allowing them to be more competitive in the day-ahead energy market. The problem is formulated as a bilevel optimization in which the upper level represents the regulating authority whose objective function is to minimize the total cost of subsidies given to producers and the lower level represents the day-ahead market clearing process. This nonlinear bilevel model is then transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming problem that can be solved using commercial tools. Numerical studies demonstrate that implementing the proposed approach would make it possible to achieve any feasible emissions target at a much lower tax rate. © 2018 IEEE.","Bilevel programming; Carbon tax; Emissions; MPEC; Subsidies","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Electric power systems; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Integer programming; Particulate emissions; Taxation; Bi-level programming; Carbon taxes; Day-ahead energy markets; Mixed integer linear programming problems; MPEC; Production of electric energy; Regulating authorities; Subsidies; Power markets","Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability, , http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg2/WGIIAR5-PartAFINAL.pdf; Inventory of U.

However, the high generation cost leads to the NGFE cannot compete economically with the coal-fired electricity (CFE) when the value of peak power and positive environment externality of NGEF are not considered. Therefore, the market reform of natural gas (NG), including price deregulation, carbon tax and environmental subsidy are of vital importance to promote the penetration of NGFE. In the present study, a dynamic game-theoretic model was developed to analyze the impacts of market reforming for natural gas on the promotion effect of NGFE, in which the hourly real-time pricing (RTP) was applied in both natural gas and electricity markets. Five scenarios were proposed with different policy combinations of pricing mechanism reform, carbon tax and environmental subsidy. Based on the analysis results, it can be concluded that (i) deregulating the NG price, imposing carbon tax and adopting environment subsidy can promote the market penetration of NGFE greatly; and (ii) the market deregulation can increases the share of NGFE to 5.49%, and imposing the carbon tax of 100 RMB/tonne CO2 can raise it further to 7.66%, furthermore if the environmental subsidy of 134.3 RMB/MWh is also included, the share of NGFE can reach 15%. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon tax; Environmental subsidy; Game-theoretic model; Market deregulation; Natural gas-fired electricity","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Costs; Economics; Game theory; Gases; Natural gas; Power markets; Taxation; Carbon taxes; Coal-fired electricity; Environmental subsidy; Game-theoretic model; Market deregulation; Market penetration; Policy combination; Price deregulation; Deregulation; coal-fired power plant; deregulation; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy market; natural gas; pollution tax; pricing policy; subsidy system; sustainable development; theoretical study; China","http://www.nea.gov.cn/2013-02/20/c_132180424.htm, National Energy Administration.

Neglecting the synergistic effect of each energy environmental tax and levying carbon tax, sulfur tax and nitrogen tax at the same time will overestimate the abatement cost of air emissions. This study adopts a partial equilibrium model which uses linear demand and supply curves to illustrate the emission reductions in carbon tax, sulfur tax and nitrogen tax. The synergistic reduction effects of CO2, SO2 and NOx are firstly evaluated under the implicit tax scenario of resource tax and consumption tax on fossil fuels. Then it is compared with the synergistic reduction effects of CO2, SO2 and NOx under different explicit tax scenarios of increasing tax rate on carbon tax, sulfur tax and nitrogen tax. If the synergistic reduction effect of explicit environmental taxes is better, this research aims to find one kind of environmental tax among carbon tax, sulfur tax and nitrogen tax with the best synergistic reduction effect and to provide a decision support for the policy makers of energy environmental taxes. The results indicate that explicit environmental taxes have better synergistic reduction effects compared with the current implicit environmental taxes. And explicit sulfur tax can lead to the largest synergistic reduction effects of CO2, SO2 and NOx. Therefore, the policy makers of energy environmental taxes could consider adopting the explicit sulfur tax to reduce various environmental air emissions at the largest amount. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Carbon tax; China; Nitrogen tax; Sulfur tax; Synergistic reduction effect","emission inventory; environmental tax; nitrogen; pollution tax; sulfur; China","Agee, M.D., Non-separable pollution control: implications for a CO2 emissions cap and trade system (2014) Resour Energy Econ, 36, pp. 64-82; Baumol, W.J., Wilson, C.A., (2001) Welfare economics, , Edward Elgar, Cheltenham; Cao, D., (2005) Economy & Environment China 2020, , China Environmental Science Press, Beijing: (in Chinese); Cao, J., Diesel demand per capita elasticities in China, 1999–2007 (2011) J Tsinghua Univ (Sci&Tech), 51 (2), pp. 241-244. , (in Chinese); Dahl, C., Duggan, T.E., US energy product supply elasticities: a survey and application to the US oil market (1996) Resour Energy Econ, 18 (3), pp. 243-263; (2013) China Energy Statistical Yearbook 2013, , China Statistics Press, Beijing; Feng, L., The construction and quantitative analysis of the demand model of natural gas market in Shanghai (2009) Nat Gas Ind, 29 (2), pp. 120-122. , (in Chinese); Gao, C., Historical analysis of SO2 pollution control policies in China (2009) Environ Manage, 43, pp. 447-457; (2013) China Tax Yearbook 2013, , China Statistics Press, Beijing; (2006) National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme, 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, , The Institute for Global Environmental Strategies, Japan; Climate change 2013: the physical science basis: working group I contribution to the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change (2014) Cambridge University Press; Krichene, N., World crude oil and natural gas: a demand and supply model (2002) Energy Econ, 24 (6), pp. 557-576; Krichene, N., (2005) A simultaneous equations model for world crude oil and natural gas markets. IMF Working Paper No. 05/32, , http://ssrn.com/abstract=874253; Li, L., Lei, Y., Pan, D., Economic and environmental evaluation of coal production in China and policy implications (2015) Nat Hazards, 77 (2), pp. 1125-1141; Lin, B., China’s long-term coal demand: impacts and policy choice (2007) Econ Res J, 2, pp. 48-58. , (in Chinese); Lin, C., The elasticity of demand for gasoline in China (2013) Energy Policy, 59, pp. 189-197; Liu, Z., Reduced carbon emission estimates from fossil fuel combustion and cement production in China (2015) Nature, 524 (7565), pp. 335-338; (2013) China Environmental Statistics Yearbook 2013, , China Statistics Press, Beijing; Shakya, S.R., Co-benefits of a carbon tax in Nepal (2012) Mitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change, 17, pp. 77-101; Tian, H., Nitrogen oxides emissions arising from commercial energy consumption in China (2001) Environ Sci, 22 (6), pp. 24-28. , (in Chinese); Turpin, B.J., Lim, H.J., Species contributions to PM2.5 mass concentrations: revisiting common assumptions for estimating organic mass (2001) Aerosol Sci Technol, 35, pp. 602-610; Wang, J., Implementing climate-friendly strategy for air pollution prevention and control (2010) China Soft Sci, 10, pp. 28-36. , (in Chinese); Xu, Y., Masui, T., Local air pollutant emission reduction and ancillary carbon benefits of SO2 control policies: application of AIM/CGE model to China (2009) Eur J Oper Res, 198, pp. 315-325; Yan, L., (2014) The practice study of China and abroad on energy environmental tax and China’s countermeasures, , Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing: (in Chinese); Yokoyama, A., Green tax reform: converting implicit carbon taxes to a pure carbon tax (2000) Environ Econ Policy Stud, 3 (1), pp. 1-20; Zhang, Z., (2010) Environmental taxes and fees in the field of consumption, , Fudan University Press, Shanghai: (in Chinese); Zhang, Q., NOx emission trends for China, 1995–2004: the view from the ground and the view from space (2007) J Geophys Res Atmos, 1984-2012, p. 112","Springer Netherlands",Article,Scopus

The retailer moves first to decide a cost-sharing contract, then the manufacturer determines the energy-saving level, carbon-emission level, and wholesale price successively. In the end, the retailer determines the retail price. As a regulation, the government provides subsidies for energy-saving products, while imposing a carbon tax on the carbon emitted. The results show that (1) both the energy-saving cost-sharing (ECS) and the carbon emissions reduction cost-sharing (CCS) contracts are not the dominant strategy of the two parties by which they can facilitate energy savings and emissions reductions; (2) compared with single cost-sharing contracts, the bivariate cost-sharing (BCS) contract for energy saving and emissions reduction is superior, although it still cannot realise prefect coordination of the supply chain; (3) government subsidy and carbon tax policies can promote the cooperation of both the upstream and downstream enterprises of the supply chain-a subsidy policy can always drive energy saving and emissions reductions, while a carbon tax policy does not always exert positive effects, as it depends on the initial level of pollution and the level of carbon tax; and (4) the subsidy policy reduces the coordination efficiency of the supply chain, while the influences of carbon tax policy upon the coordination efficiency relies on the initial carbon-emission level. © 2018 by the authors.","Carbon-emission level; Cost-sharing contract; Energy-saving level; Supply chain management",,"Friedler, F., Process integration, modelling and optimisation for energy saving and pollution reduction (2010) Appl.

Since the Paris summit in 2015, there has been a growing interest in carbon tax that has begun to increase again. Although Turkey’s share of carbon emissions in terms of total global emissions is low, the rate of increase in emissions has increased in recent years and should be a cause for concern. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyze the possible effects of carbon taxes on Turkey’s economy by disaggregating the electricity sector a by using the computable general equilibrium model. Simulation results show that carbon taxation is a highly effective means to reduce carbon emissions. Despite all sectors being adversely affected, some low emission energy, textile, and other service sectors benefit from carbon pricing. The results also indicate macroeconomic costs of imposing a carbon tax at $7 per ton of carbon in terms of the decrease in GDP by 0.061% and associated with per capita utility of the representative household by 0.09% in scenario a. Imposition of successively higher carbon taxes in scenario b and scenario c results in 5.75, 12.02, and 16.95% reduction in carbon emissions at decreasing rate, respectively. However, these reductions are also accompanied by a decrease in real GDP and per capita utility from household expenditure, as macroeconomic costs, in scenarios a, b, and c at increasing rates. © The Author(s) 2018.","carbon emission; Carbon taxation; computable general equilibrium; Turkey","Cost reduction; Economics; Taxation; Carbon emissions; Carbon taxation; Computable general equilibrium; Computable general equilibrium model; Electricity sector; European Countries; Household expenditure; Turkey; Carbon; carbon emission; computable general equilibrium analysis; computer simulation; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; household expenditure; macroecology; numerical model; pollution tax; Turkey","Sumner, J., Bird, L., Smith, H., (2009) Carbon taxes: a review of experience and policy design considerations, p. 1. , National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Technical Report NRL/TP -6A2-47312.

An alternative, ‘nudge,’ approach promises smaller benefits but with much lower costs. However, nudges aimed at reducing carbon emissions could have a pernicious indirect effect if they offer the promise of a ‘quick fix’ and thereby undermine support for policies of greater impact. Across six experiments, including one conducted with individuals involved in policymaking, we show that introducing a green energy default nudge diminishes support for a carbon tax. We propose that nudges decrease support for substantive policies by providing false hope that problems can be tackled without imposing considerable costs. Consistent with this account, we show that by minimizing the perceived economic cost of the tax and disclosing the small impact of the nudge, eliminates crowding-out without diminishing support for the nudge. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"cost analysis; energy efficiency; environmental economics; environmental policy; pollution tax; public attitude","Allcott, H., Social norms and energy conservation (2011) J.

Hence, it becomes increasingly urgent to propose a feasible and effective scheme to restrict emissions in the aviation industry. We develop a two-stage game model to analyze three possible strategies (non-resistance, refusal of payment and ACT retaliation) in nine scenarios for three groups (the EU, developing countries and non-EU developed countries). The theoretical analyses and numerical simulations reveal that the EU will continue to impose the ACT. Simultaneously, imposing retaliatory ACT constitutes an ideal choice for non-EU developed countries. At present, refusing to pay the ACT is a practical strategy for developing countries; however, after the transitional phase, this group will tend to impose the ACT as developed countries by paying attention to increasing climate change. With optimal strategies for the above three groups, the ACT can be imposed effectively and efficiently by multilateral agreements within the framework of the market-based measure (MBM) scheme. This paper develops a game framework to simulate the ACT effect and to solve emission problems in the aviation industry by a multilateral perspective to achieve sustainability, which is of practical significance for nations and economies. © 2017 by the authors.","Aviation carbon tax (ACT); Equilibrium tax rate; Market-based measure (MBM) scheme; Optimal strategies; Two-stage game","aircraft emission; airline industry; climate change; developing world; emission control; European Union; game theory; international agreement; pollution tax; sustainability","Babiker, M.H., Rutherford, T.F., The economic effects of border measures in subglobal climate agreements (2005) Energy J., 26, pp. 99-126; Asselt, H.V., Brewer, T., Addressing competitiveness and leakage concerns in climate policy: An analysis of border adjustment measures in the US and the EU (2010) Energy Policy, 38, pp. 42-51; Dissou, Y., Eyland, T., Carbon control policies, competitiveness, and border tax adjustments (2011) Energy Econ., 33, pp. 556-564; Eyland, T., Zaccour, G., Strategic effects of a border tax adjustment (2012) Int.

"Voorspools K., Peermans I., D'haeseleer W.","A comparative analysis of energy and CO2 taxes on the primary energy mix for electricity generation",2005,"International Journal of Energy Research","10.1002/er.1101","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-23844557876&doi=10.1002%2fer.1101&partnerID=40&md5=e2614c628a1c31fc892de6bbab0bbd5f","In many countries, economies are moving towards internalization of external costs of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. This can best be achieved by either imposing additional taxes or by using an emission-permit-trading scheme. The electricity sector is under scrutiny in the allocation of emission-reduction objectives, not only because it is a large homogeneous target, but also because of the obvious emission-reduction potential by decreasing power generation based on carbon-intensive fuels. In this paper, we discuss the impact of a primary-energy tax and a CO2 tax on the dispatching strategy in power generation. In a case study for the Belgian power-generating context, several tax levels are investigated and the impact on the optimal dispatch is simulated. The impact of the taxes on the power demand or on the investment strategies is not considered. As a conclusion, we find that a CO2 tax is more effective than a primary-energy tax. Both taxes accomplish an increased generation efficiency in the form of a promotion of combined-cycle gas-fired units over coal-fired units. The CO2 tax adds an incentive for fuel switching which can be achieved by altering the merit order of power plants or by switching to a fuel with a lower carbon content within a plant. For the CO2 tax, 13 €/tonCO2 is withheld as the optimal value which results in an emission reduction of 13% of the electricity-related GHG emissions in the Belgian power context of 2000. A tax higher than 13 €/tonCO2 does not contribute to the further reduction of GHGs.

Despite the long history of theoretical and computable general equilibrium, supply-side models, the empirical basis of much of this work has been quite weak until recently. However, most econometric attempts to capture factor substitution effects have not been based on theoretically consistent structures. This paper examines the methodological issues that underlie these problems and compares the results of imposing environmental taxes in two different econometric modelling structures. The implications of theories of endogenous technical progress on the simulation properties of such models are discussed, and a simple empirically based model that embodies some of these features is presented.","Endogenous technical progress; Environmental taxation; Macroeconomic modelling","Economic and social effects; Mathematical models; Taxation; Endogenous technical progress; Environmental taxation; Macroeconomic modelling; Environmental protection; carbon tax; econometric modelling; empirical study; environmental tax; macroeconomic effect; simulation model","Allen, C., A supply side model of the UK economy: An application of non-linear cointegration (1994) Centre for Economic Forecasting Discussion Paper DP 19-94, , London Business School; Allen, C., Nixon, J., Two concepts of the NAIRU (1995) Centre for Economic Forecasting Discussion Paper DP 28-95, , London Business School; Allen, C., Urga, G., Derivation and estimation of interrelated factor demands from dynamic cost function (1995) Centre for Economic Forecasting Discussion Paper DP 10-95, , London Business School; Allen, C., Hall, S., Nixon, J., The new London business school model of the UK economy (1994) Centre for Economic Forecasting Discussion Paper DP 18-94, , London Business School; Anderson, G., Blundell, R., Consumer non-durables in the U.K: A dynamic demand system (1984) Economic Journal, 94 (SUPPL.), pp. 35-44; Barker, T., Taxing pollution instead of employment: Greenhouse gas abatement through fiscal policy in the U.K (1994) University of Birmingham Discussion Paper 94-10; Barker, T., Gardiner, B., Employment, wage formation and pricing in the european union: Empirical modelling of environmental tax reform (1994) Nternational Workshop on Environmental Taxation, Revenue Recycling and Unemployment, , Milan; Bohm, P., (1995) Environmental Taxes, Carbon Taxes, Tax Recycling and Tax Distortions, , Mimeo, Department of Economics, University of Stockholm; Bovenberg, L., De Mooij, R., Environmental levies and distortionary taxation (1994) American Economic Review, 84 (4), pp. 1085-1089; Bovenberg, L., Goulder, L., Costs of environmentally motivated taxes in the presence of other taxes: General equilibrium analysis (1994) International Workshop on Environmental Taxation, Revenue Recycling and Unemployment, , Milan; Bovenberg, L., Van Der Ploeg, F., Tax reform, structural unemployment and the environment (1994) International Workshop on Environmental Taxation, Revenue Recycling and Unemployment, , Milan; Capros, P., Georgakopolous, P., Zografakis, S., Proost, S., Van Regemorter, D., Conrad, C., Schmidt, T., Michiels, E., Double dividend analysis: First results of a general equilibrium model (GEM-E3) linking the EU-12 countries (1994) International Workshop on Environmental Taxation, Revenue Recycling and Unemployment, , Milan; Carraro, C., Soubeyran, A., Environmental taxation and employment in a multi-sector general equilibrium model (1994) International Workshop on Environmental Taxation, Revenue Recycling and Unemployment, , Milan; Chung, J.W., On the estimation of factor substitution in the translog model (1987) Review of Economics and Statistics, 64, pp. 409-417; Chung, J.W., (1994) Utility and Production Functions, , Blackwell; Cuthbertson, K., Hall, S.G., Taylor, M.P.T., (1992) Applied Econometric Techniques, , Phillip Allen, London; Denny, M., Fuss, M., The use of approximation analysis to test for separability and the existence of consistent aggregates (1977) American Economic Review, 67, pp. 404-417; (1993) GEM Model Manual, , London Business School/National Institute; Griffin, J.M., Gregory, P.R., An international translog model of energy substitution responses (1976) American Economic Review, 66, pp. 845-857; Layard, R., Nickell, S., Jackman, R., (1991) Unemployment: Macroeconomic Performance and the Labour Market, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; O'Mahoney, M., Capital stock and productivity in industrial nations (1993) National Institute Economic Review, 145; Pindyck, R.S., Inter-fuel substitution and the industrial demand for energy: An international comparison (1979) Review of Economics and Statistics, 61, pp. 169-179; Smith, C., Carbon leakage in incomplete CO2 abatement treaties (1994) Centre for Economic Forecasting Discussion Paper DP 26-94, , London Business School; Smith, C., Hall, S., Mabey, N., Econometric modelling of international carbon tax regimes (1995) Energy Economics, 17 (2), pp. 133-146; (1992) United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, , UN, Geneva","Elsevier",Article,Scopus

Scenario analysis estimates several impacts from adjusting current policies that affect timberland investment, area, harvests, and carbon. First, increases in tax rates faced by timberland owners cause timber assets to be revalued downward even though the physical forest is initially unchanged, resulting in substantial declines in both regeneration and management. Second, timber stocks fall over time, reflecting a decrease in investment. Third, tax revenues could increase by nearly $3.4 billion/yr compared to baseline, but at the expense of increasing trade deficits by up to $3.3 billion/yr. Fourth, timberland area could decrease by 12 million hectares. Last, cumulative carbon sequestration over the next 50 years could be reduced by more than 3 billion tCO2e, −22% from the current policy baseline if forestland tax incentives are removed. Fifth, maintaining the existing tax policies in perpetuity incentivizes carbon sequestration levels equivalent to imposing a price of $70/tCO2e on the forest sector, highlighting the ecosystem service benefits of maintaining current tax policy. Finally, we estimate that current US forest tax policy provides about $8 billion/yr in climate change mitigation benefits by 2050. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon Sequestration; Ecosystem Services; Harvest; Investment; Taxation; Timber","baseline conditions; climate change; ecosystem service; environmental economics; forest ecosystem; forest management; market conditions; pollution tax; profitability; tax reform; timber market; United States","Amacher, G.S., Government preferences and public forest harvesting: a second-best approach (1999) Am.

They are integrating environmental practices into their operations to curb carbon emissions. Regulatory bodies are also imposing carbon policies to check emission. In this paper, we developed three models considering three carbon policies (I. carbon tax, II. strict cap and III. cap-and-trade) and have determined the optimal order quantity and number of shipments for a two-echelon supply chain. The objective is to minimize the total supply chain cost which comprises the ordering, setup, production, inventory holding and transportation costs. In Model I tax on carbon emissions has been included in the cost function; in Model II we have considered a strict carbon cap on the total carbon emission; and in Model III trading price of carbon is included in the cost function. A numerical study is given to illustrate the solution procedure. Further, sensitivity analyses are performed to examine the impact of the various parameters on the total cost and total emission. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cap-and-trade policy; Carbon tax policy; strict cap policy; vendor–buyer model","Commerce; Competition; Cost functions; Costs; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Cap and trade; Carbon taxes; Competitive advantage; Environmental practices; Optimal order quantity; Solution procedure; Transportation cost; Two-echelon supply chain; Cost benefit analysis","Abdallah, T., Diabat, A., Simchi-Levi, D., (2010) A Carbon Sensitive Supply Chain Network Problem with Green Procurement, , Proceedings of the 40th International Conference on Computers and Industrial Engineering (CIE), Awaji, Japan:; Abhishek, N., Nidhi, M.B., Pillai, V.M., (2012) Carbon Assessment Model for Supply Chain Network, , Proceeding of the International Conference on Green Technologies (ICGT), Trivandrum, India:; Absi, N., Dauzère-Pérès, S., Kedad-Sidhoum, S., Penz, B., Rapine, C., Lot Sizing with Carbon Emission Constraints (2012) European Journal of Operational Research, 227 (1), pp. 55-61; Benjaafar, S., Li, Y., Daskin, M., Carbon Footprint and the Management of Supply Chains: Insights from Simple Models (2013) IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, 10 (1), pp. 99-116; Bouchery, Y., Ghaffari, A., Jemai, Z., Dallery, Y., Including Sustainability Criteria into Inventory Models (2012) European Journal of Operational Research, 222 (2), pp. 229-240; Carbon Footprint in the Supply Chain: The Next Step for Business (2006) Carbon Trust, , https://www.carbontrust.com/media/84932/ctc616-carbon-footprints-in-the-supply-chain.pdf; Carter, C.R., Rogers, D.S., A Framework of Sustainable Supply Chain Management: Moving toward New Theory (2008) International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 38 (5), pp. 360-387; Carter, C.R., Easton, P.L., Sustainable Supply Chain Management: Evolution and Future Directions (2011) International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 41 (1), pp. 46-62; Chen, W.T., Li, Y.P., Huang, G.H., Chen, X., Li, Y.F., A Two-stage Inexact-stochastic Programming Model for Planning Carbon Dioxide Emission Trading under Uncertainty (2010) Applied Energy, 87 (3), pp. 1033-1047; Chen, X., Benjaafar, S., Elomri, A., The Carbon-Constrained EOQ (2013) Operations Research Letters, 41 (2), pp. 172-179; Ciliberti, F., Pontrandolfo, P., Scozzi, B., Logistics Social Responsibility: Standard Adoption and Practices in Italian Companies (2008) International Journal of Production Economics, 113 (1), pp. 88-106; Darnall, N., Jolley, G.J., Handfield, R., Green Supply Chain Management: Complements for Sustainability?

We exploit the 26 different circulation tax rules and their variation over time, which we interpret as a natural experiment, to see if linking them to a vehicle's CO2 emissions rate has helped shift new car sales towards lower-emitting vehicles. We find that even when the penalty associated with a highly polluting vehicle is high, the effect is relatively small. For example, in canton Zurich, imposing a 50% “malus” on the annual registration fee for cars that emit 200 or more grams of CO2 per kilometer reduces the average CO2 emissions rate from new cars by only 0.46 g per kilometer, bringing it to 158.11 g per kilometer in 2011. A similar effect would be attained with a modest increase in fuel taxes. Bonus policies may trigger new car sales and engender a net increase in CO2 emissions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide emissions rates; Fuel economy; Fuel taxes; Vehicle demand estimation; Vehicle taxes","Carbon dioxide; Fuel economy; Fuels; Global warming; Sales; Carbon dioxide emissions; CO2 emissions; Demand estimation; Federal governments; Fuel tax; Natural experiment; Road vehicles; Vehicle taxes; Taxation; annual variation; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; energy policy; fuel consumption; pollution tax; traffic emission; Switzerland; Zurich [Switzerland]","(2016), http://www.are.admin.ch/dokumentation/publikationen/00015/00557/index.html?lang=de&download=NHzLpZeg7t,lnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1acy4Zn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCEeYN9gmym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A, Externe Kosten und Nutzen des Verkehrs in der Schweiz.

This paper explores in a general equilibrium framework the sectoral and welfare implications of a unilateral domestic GHG control policy combined with a BTA scheme. Using the Canadian economy as an illustration, we assess the extent to which BTAs achieve their objectives and analyze the impacts of different methods of recycling the BTA proceeds to support domestic industries. Our simulation results suggest that imposing BTAs on the imports of non-fossil and energy-intensive products reduces or removes completely the negative competitiveness impacts that domestic industries suffer from. The use of the proceeds of the BTAs to support domestic energy-intensive industries improves their competitiveness and, more importantly, in some cases, overprotects them, as it allows them to even increase their output in comparison to the benchmark without emissions control. Our results also shed light on the existence of heterogeneity in the composition of energy-intensive industries as far as the recycling method of the BTA proceeds is concerned. Energy-intensive industries that are more oriented toward the domestic market are better off with the recycling of the BTA proceeds towards gross output than towards exports alone. Finally, abstracting from the environmental benefits of reduced emissions, we find that a BTA entails a higher welfare cost to households. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Border tax adjustment; Canada; Competitiveness; Energy-intensive industries; General equilibrium","Border tax adjustments; Canada; Competitiveness; Energy-intensive industries; General equilibrium; Competition; Industry; International trade; Recycling; Taxation; Pollution control; carbon emission; competitiveness; environmental policy; general equilibrium analysis; greenhouse gas; pollution control; pollution tax; Canada","Babiker, M.H., Thomas, F.R., The economic effects of border measures in subglobal climate agreements (2005) The Energy Journal, 26 (4), pp. 99-126; Barrett, S., (2003) Environment and Statecraft, , Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK; Carraro, C., Siniscalco, D., Strategies for the international protection of the environment (1993) Journal of Public Economics, 52, pp. 309-328; Courchene, T.J., Allan, J.R., Climate change: the case for a carbon tariff/tax (2008) Policy Options, March, pp. 59-64; de Cendra, J., Can emissions trading schemes be coupled with border tax adjustments?

The microgrid was composed of seven components - solar photovoltaics, wind-turbines, lead acid batteries, biodiesel generators, fuel cells, electrolyzers and H2 tanks. Firstly, mathematical models that predicted the hourly power generation were developed for every microgrid component. Secondly, Artificial Neural Networks were utilized to predict hourly electricity demand and its results were validated with actual available data. Thirdly, through an electricity dispatch strategy and a Genetic Algorithm optimization technique, microgrid configurations were determined that had lowest levelized cost of energy, $/kWh. From peak power standpoint, four microgrid-conventional grid integration scenarios were examined, namely, microgrid possessing penetration level of 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%. Based on the environmental life cycle assessment of power generation, three carbon taxes were imposed -$12, $48, $72/tonne carbon dioxide emitted. Microgrid's electricity cost was found to be $0.43–0.86/kWh. Imposing carbon taxes barely showed any effect on microgrid's electricity cost nor its optimum configuration, but conventional grid's electricity cost was found to increase by 7–33% as its carbon emissions were five times as that of microgrid. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial neural network; Carbon tax; Environmental assessment (LCA); Genetic algorithm optimization; Microgrid; Techno-economic assessment","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Environmental management; Fuel cells; Genetic algorithms; Lead acid batteries; Life cycle; Neural networks; Solar power generation; Wind turbines; Carbon taxes; Environmental assessment; Genetic-algorithm optimizations; Micro grid; Techno-economic assessment; Electric load dispatching","A Mahesh, K.S., A genetic algorithm based improved optimal sizing strategy for solar-wind-battery hybrid system using energy filter algorithm (2017) Front.

A partial equilibrium model of the agricultural sector is used to assess economic and environmental effects. The results show that the introduction of a climate tax corresponding to the existing Swedish CO2 tax of 115 euros per tonne carbon dioxide equivalent reduces total emissions from food consumption by 4.4% without any refunding of tax revenues. Refunding with payments for all ecosystems enhances the carbon sink by an amount equivalent to 57% of CO2e emissions from food consumption, and results in net benefits in the tax refund system for the agricultural sector as a whole, but is regressive where farmers in regions with relatively high incomes receive proportionally much of the net benefits. © 2020 The Authors","Climate tax; Food consumption; Partial equilibrium analysis; Sweden; Tax refunding",,"Aidt, T., Green taxes: refunding rules and lobbying (2010) J.

To meet climate-change mitigation targets, environmental policy instruments have been designed to transform the way goods and services are produced as well as alter consumption patterns. The government of Malaysia is strongly committed to reducing CO2 gas emissions as a proportion of GDP by 40% from 2005 levels by the year 2020. This study evaluates the economy-wide impacts of implementing two different types of CO2 emission abatement policies in Malaysia using market-based (imposing a carbon tax) and command-and-control mechanism (sectoral emission standards). The policy simulations conducted involve the removal of the subsidy on petroleum products by the government. A carbon emission tax in conjunction with the revenue neutrality assumption is seen to be more effective than a command-and-control policy as it provides a double dividend. This is apparent as changes in consumption patterns lead to welfare enhancements while contributing to reductions in CO2 emissions. The simulation results show that the production of renewable energies is stepped up when the imposition of carbon tax and removal of the subsidy is augmented by revenue recycling. This study provides an economy-wide assessment that compares two important tools for assisting environment policy makers evaluate carbon emission abatement initiatives in Malaysia. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon tax; CGE modelling; Command-and-control; Environmental effects; Hicksian welfare","Climate change; Economic and social effects; Economics; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Global warming; Taxation; Carbon taxes; Climate change mitigation; Command and control; Consumption patterns; Environment policies; Environmental policy; Hicksian welfare; Renewable energies; Carbon dioxide; petroleum; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; computable general equilibrium analysis; economic impact; emission control; environmental economics; environmental impact; environmental policy; policy making; pollution tax; state role; welfare impact; Article; carbon footprint; computer model; controlled study; economic aspect; environmental impact; environmental policy; environmental protection; government; market; policy; recycling; renewable energy; simulation; standard; tax; welfare; Malaysia","Adams, P.D., Horridge, J.M., Parmenter, B.R., MMRF-GREEN: A Dynamic, Multi-sectoral, Multi-regional Model of Australia (2000), Monash University, Centre of Policy Studies/IMPACT Centre; Ang, J.B., Economic development, pollutant emissions and energy consumption in Malaysia (2008) J.

In this respect, it is imperative to explore different greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions reduction options in developing countries under the framework of Kyoto Protocol. A number of analyses reveal that half of the global emission reductions can be achieved by substituting fossil fuel by non-fossil fuel (e.g., nuclear and renewable energy) sources for electric power generation. Pricing policies are more likely to achieve such a substitution resulting in a significant CO2 emissions reduction. For this, a carbon emission penalty on fossil fuel based generation is one of the mechanisms of pricing carbon emissions. Imposing a carbon emission penalty on the fossil fuel generation enhances renewable based energy generation to substitute carbon intensive power generation. This effect is called the ""substitution effect"". The corollary effect of imposing emission penalties on fossil fuel generating plants will be an increase in the average electricity price. This, in turn, will decrease the energy demand from customers due to the negative price elasticity of electricity demand. This effect is called the ""price effect"". This paper examines the substitution and price effect of carbon emission penalties on fossil fuel generation in mitigating CO2 emissions from distributed generations (DGs) in a developing country. Also discussed will be the costs and benefits of emission penalties as well as other policy optiosin it tl as other policy options in mitigating environmental emissions from the renewable based DG resources, such as wind, biomass, and PVs.","CO2 emissions; Distribution generation; Kyoto protocol; Price effect; Substution effect","Air pollution; Climate control; Control systems; Developing countries; Electric breakdown; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Energy resources; Environmental protection; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Leakage (fluid); Power transmission; Public policy; Reduction; Renewable energy resources; Carbon tax; CO2 emissions; Distributed resources; Distribution generation; Electric powers; Emissions reductions; Global emissions; Kyoto protocol; Power systems; Price effect; Pricing policies; Renewable energies; Substution effect; Power generation","Shrestha, R.M., Shrestha, R., Bhattacharya, S.C., Environmental and electricity planning implications of carbon tax and technology constraints in a developing country Energy Policy, 26 (7), pp. 527-533; Hoeller, P., Wallin, M., Energy prices, taxes and carbon dioxide emissions (1991) OECD Economic Studies, (17). , Autumn; Goto, N., Macroeconomic and sectoral impacts of carbon taxation: A case of Japanese economy (1995) Energy Economics, 17 (4), pp. 277-295; Rajah, N., Smith, S., Using Taxes to reduce Externalities: Experiences in Western Europe (1994) Annual Review of Energy and Environment, 19, pp. 75-504; Turkson, J., Wohlgemuth, N., Power sector reform and distributed generation in sub-Saharan Africa (2001) Energy Policy, 29, pp. 35-145; Banerjee, R., Comparison of options for distributed generation in India (2005) Energy Policy, 34 (1), pp. 101-111; HOMER Web site, , www.nrel.gov/international/homer, National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL, 2005; Hansen, J., Bower, J., (2003) An economic evaluation of small-scale distributed electricity generation technologies, , Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, Oxford;; Shukla, P.R., Biswas, D., Nag, T., Yajnik, A., Heller, T., Victor, D.G., (2004) Impact of power sector reforms on technology, efficiency and emissions: Case study of Gujarat, , India, Program on Energy and Sustainable Development, Stanford University, Stanford, California, Working Paper Number 2;; Scrimgeour, F., Oxley, L., Fatai, K., Reducing carbon emissions?

However, experience around the world suggests that carbon taxes face exceedingly difficult political hurdles. Federal experience in the United States and in Canada confirms this pattern. This article reviews sub-federal policy development among American states and Canadian provinces, a great many of which have pursued climate policy development. With one major exception, explicit carbon taxation appears to remain a political nonstarter. At the same time, states and provinces have been placing indirect carbon prices on fossil fuel use through a wide range of policies. These tend to strategically alter labeling, avoiding the terms of ""tax"" and ""carbon"" in imposing costs. The article offers a framework for considering such strategies and examines common design features, including direct linkage between cost imposition and fund usage to build political support. © 2012 by The Policy Studies Organization.","Canada; Carbon taxation; Climate change; Climate policy; Energy taxation; North America; State and provincial environmental policy; United States","carbon emission; climate change; emission control; environmental economics; environmental policy; federal system; policy development; policy strategy; tax system; Canada; United States","Alarie, B., Poschmann, F., (2010) Ontario's green energy ""fee"": The trouble with taxation through regulation, , Toronto, ON: C.D.

Environmental regulations are being enforced and lower-carbon products are being produced in order to maintain competitiveness when complying with such regulations. This paper aims to explore the effect of CE on profit through three kinds of models using the activity-based costing (ABC) approach. The results indicate that governmental policy makers can effectively decrease CE by Total Quantity Control (TQC) to resolve problems of environmental degradation. Governmental policy makers can control CE by limiting the quantities of CE, thereby forcing manufacturers to decrease CE during production. Furthermore, policy makers can set up regulations on CE quotas to control CE well instead of imposing carbon taxes. Therefore, manufacturers will try their best to find methods of improving production processes, equipment, and/or materials to decrease the CE quantity and achieve maximum profit under the restricted carbon emissions quotas. © 2018 by the authors.","Activity-based costing (ABC); Cap & trade; Carbon emissions; Footwear industry; Green production","carbon emission; competitiveness; cost analysis; environmental degradation; environmental economics; environmental issue; environmental policy; manufacturing; quality control; regulatory framework","(2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, 6, p. 333. , IPCC: Geneva, Switzerland; Maciel, V.G., Bockorny, G., Domingues, N., Scherer, M.B., Zortea, R.B., Seferin, M., Comparative Life Cycle Assessment among Three Polyurethane Adhesive Technologies for the Footwear Industry (2017) ACS Sustain.

This model evaluates the effects of imposing a carbon tax on various carbon-emitting technologies in order to reduce CO2 emissions. It also estimates the effects of a carbon tax in combination with subsidies. The problem can be formulated in terms of two-level mathematical programming. An algorithm is proposed and applied to estimate Japanese CO2 emissions. The conditions under which energy-saving technologies would be selected are analyzed using various carbon tax rates and subsidies, and the reduction of CO2 emissions is calculated based on the introduction of such technologies. It is found that a low carbon tax such as 3000 yen per metric ton of carbon (tC) is insufficient to stabilize CO2 emissions at the 1990 level in Japan, and that a tax of 30 000 yen/tC would be necessary. However, the proposed algorithm shows that total emissions in Japan in the year 2000 can be stabilized at the 1990 level with a tax of 3000 yen/tC if the tax revenues are used to subsidize the introduction of energy-saving technologies.",,"Air pollution control; Algorithms; Carbon dioxide; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Mathematical programming; Taxation; Carbon emitting technologies; Carbon tax; Decision support systems","Long-Term Energy Supply-Demand Outlook., , Tokyo, Japan: Research Institute of International Trade and Industry, 1994; Aiyoshi, E., Shimizu, K., IEEE Trans.

A key pillar of the plan is the introduction of a pan-Canadian carbon price by the end of 2018. However, four Canadian provinces, nearly 85% of the Canadian economy and population, have already implemented carbon pricing systems. British Columbia (BC) has a carbon tax. Alberta is transitioning from an output-based allocation system for industrial emitters to a hybrid system combining a carbon levy and refined output-based system. Québec and Ontario have implemented cap-and-trade systems, linked to California. Recognizing these existing systems, rather than impose a single carbon pricing mechanism, the Pan-Canadian Approach to Carbon Pricing gives provinces and territories the flexibility to adopt a carbon tax, a hybrid system, or a cap-and-trade system. To address concerns relating to ‘fairness’ and equivalency of carbon price, a federal carbon pricing benchmark establishes criteria relating to minimum ‘common scope’ and ‘increases in stringency’ that provincial and territorial carbon pricing systems must meet. This article explores the design features of the existing Alberta, BC, Ontario and Québec carbon pricing systems, and considers how the benchmark affects stringency and addresses equivalency of carbon price across these different systems. Key policy insights Canada is taking advantage of its federal structure of government to introduce a minimum pan-Canadian carbon price of $10/tCO2e in 2018, rising by $10/year to $50/tCO2e in 2022. Rather than imposing a uniform pricing mechanism, the Canadian federal government is recognizing existing subnational carbon pricing mechanisms with very different design features–BC’s carbon tax, Québec and Ontario’s cap-and-trade systems, and Alberta’s hybrid system–to deliver the pan-Canadian carbon price. In order to deliver a minimum level of increasing stringency and to address issues of equivalency of carbon price across sub-national jurisdictions, the federal government is in the early stages of implementing a federal carbon-pricing benchmark. The lessons learned from the Canadian experience will be relevant to harmonizing carbon pricing systems across both other federal jurisdictions and countries. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cap-and-trade; carbon pricing; carbon tax; equivalency; output-based allocation; Pan-Canadian framework","emissions trading; environmental policy; implementation process; policy approach; pollution tax; Alberta; British Columbia; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Quebec [Canada]","(2016) Climate leadership plan, , http://alberta.ca/climate/, Retrieved from; (2017) Carbon competitiveness incentives protect jobs, , https://www.alberta.ca/release.cfm?xID=51121C0A77352-9809-750B-7CC8BD5ED81774AD, Retrieved from; (2017) Carbon competitiveness incentive fact sheet, , https://www.alberta.ca/assets/documents/cci-fact-sheet.pdf, Retrieved from; (2017) Policy decisions regarding implementation of the output-based allocation system in, , http://aep.alberta.ca/climate-change/guidelines-legislation/specified-gas-emitters-regulation/documents/DMLetter-AllocationSystems-Mar03-2017.pdf, 2018.

At the partial equilibrium level, commuting with three workers per automobile clearly reduces highway congestion, lowers carbon emissions, and saves energy compared with three single drivers. This paper develops a numerical urban simulation model to generate the general equilibrium effects of HOV lanes on urban spatial structure, energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions. The major findings are that while HOV lanes reduce traffic congestion and improve welfare, the fall in transportation cost leads to urban sprawl, which results in higher dwelling energy use and a larger carbon footprint. Overall, the HOV lane policy has little effect on total energy consumption and carbon emissions. This is another classic case of general equilibrium effects reversing the partial equilibrium effects of an urban policy. In contrast, a gasoline tax policy leads to less urban sprawl but is less effective at lowering energy consumption and carbon emissions. Imposing congestion tolls is a more effective tool at reducing traffic congestion, saving energy, and lowering carbon emissions. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","carbon emissions; energy consumption; gasoline tax; HOV lanes; optimal congestion toll","air quality; carbon emission; computer simulation; energy use; general equilibrium analysis; numerical model; policy analysis; pollution tax; traffic congestion; traffic management; transportation policy; urban sprawl","(2010), ACS,, U.S. Census Bureau, 2010.

Our analysis is based on NATEM, an energy model that follows the TIMES approach of the International Energy Agency to represent in detail the energy sector of each of the 13 Canadian provinces and territories. NATEM shows that imposing different renewable penetration constraints for electricity generation has limited impacts outside the electricity sector. In particular, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continue to increase over time. Conversely, the imposition of a carbon tax has broader impacts on Canadian energy systems and on GHG emissions that are almost stabilized. However, the level of the carbon tax envisions by the EMF 34 study (increasing to a maximum level of $130 per tonne by 2050) is not high enough, in a Canadian context, to trigger a decrease of GHG emissions over time as mandated by Canadian climate policies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change mitigation; Low-carbon energy system; Prospective analysis; Renewable electricity; TIMES optimization Model","Carbon; Emission control; Gas emissions; Broader impacts; Carbon abatement; Climate policy; Electricity generation; Electricity sector; Energy systems; International energy agency; Maximum levels; Greenhouse gases; electricity generation; energy management; energy policy; pollution tax; renewable resource; scenario analysis; Canada","Balash, P., Nichols, C., Victor, N., “Multi-regional evaluation of the U.S. electricity sector under technology and policy uncertainties: findings from MARKAL EPA9rUS modeling” (2013) Soc.

At present, the port operator mainly takes measures of designing reasonable berth allocation for vessels and improving loading/unloading efficiency of quay cranes to reduce the carbon emission of port. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has proposed to impose carbon emission tax on ports in the long-term, which would definitely enhance the willingness of ports to reduce the carbon emission. Therefore, this paper makes effort to explore the study of integrated berth allocation and quay crane assignment problem with considering two policies of different carbon emission taxation rates on port: one is unitary taxation rate and the other is piecewise taxation rate. Two corresponding mathematical optimization models are proposed for the two policies respectively and a number of equivalent or relaxed models are developed to ease the models. Finally, a set of test instances are randomly generated to access the applicability of the proposed models and an actual case is implemented to evaluate the effect of imposing carbon emission taxation on carbon emission reduction. It is found that the carbon emission taxation policy has significant effect on berth-QC plans and the carbon emission can be significantly reduced. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon taxation; Integrated berth allocation and quay assignment; Piecewise taxation rate; Unitary taxation rate","Carbon; Combinatorial optimization; Cranes; Emission control; Optimization; Port terminals; Transfer cases (vehicles); Waterway transportation; Berth allocation; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon taxation; Environmental pollutions; International maritime organizations; Mathematical optimization model; Piece-wise; Quay crane assignment problems; Taxation; carbon emission; emission control; maritime transportation; pollution policy; pollution tax; port operation; tax system; transportation development; Gruidae","Alvarez, J.F., Longva, T., Engebrethsen, E.S., A methodology to assess vessel berthing and speed optimization policies (2010) Marit.

However, almost all current Chinese policies are emphasizing the control of CO2 emissions only, and no goals have been established for non-CO2 greenhouse gas emission reductions, China risks missing early opportunities for lower-cost abatement of the latter. Aiming to disclose the different effects of CO2 and non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions reductions and provide some suggestions for non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions reduction in China, this paper focuses on identifying the price impacts and transmitting paths among different sectors of imposing CO2, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) emission taxes using the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) model, then further compares the sources of CO2 and non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions based on the big data from the first national census of pollution sources. When the same emission tax is imposed for every ton of CO2e, the results clearly show that the prices in all sectors have the greatest increase for CO2 emissions tax scenario relative to CH4 and N2O emissions tax scenarios. With respect to sectors with larger CH4 and N2O emissions, price change in sectors with larger CO2 emissions will be responsible for the price change of almost all sectors. Moreover, from the perspective of sources of CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions, CO2 emissions are from almost all industries of the entire economy, and CH4 and N2O emissions are from agriculture, energy mining, and waste. These results indicate that the tax reducing CH4 and N2O emissions will cause lower impacts than the abatement of CO2 emissions. Integrating the current national policies with the above results, Chinese government should also pay more attention to CH4 and N2O emission reduction. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions; SAM","Big data; Costs; Emission control; Gas emissions; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Taxation; Chinese Government; Emission reduction; Empirical studies; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Nitrous oxide emissions; Pollution sources; Transmitting paths; Carbon dioxide","Akkemik, K.A., Potential impacts of electricity price changes on price formation in the economy: a social accounting matrix price modeling analysis for Turkey (2011) Energy Policy, 39, pp. 854-864; Ansari, V., Salami, H., Veeman, T., Distributional consequences of subsidy removal from agricultural and food Industry sectors in Iran: a price-based SAM analysis (2014) J.

We consider a price and service time sensitive market in which two retailers sell substitutable types of products. They compete horizontally for the same group of customers, and they decide independently the service time guaranteed to the consumers. Both retailers adopt stationary base-stock policy. We find that when carbon emissions are not regulated, the choice of service time is closely related to the focus of competition. When price competition intensifies, service competition is de-prioritized, and longer service time is used. When service competition is fierce, service time is reduced for greater market share. However, when carbon emissions are regulated by carbon tax, greater level of price competition leads to shorter service time while higher level of service competition results in longer service time, which is opposite to the unregulated situation. Furthermore, we conclude that simply imposing carbon tax may not bring the expected reduction in carbon emissions if consumers are insensitive to their carbon footprints and willing to absorb the carbon cost for speedy service. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon tax; E-commerce; Online retailing; Safety stock; Service time",,"Balasubramanian, S., Mail versus mall: a strategic analysis of competition between direct marketers and conventional retailers (1998) Mark Sci, 17 (3), pp. 181-195. , http://www.jstor.org/stable/193226; Bose, N., (2015), http://news.yahoo.com/amazon-expands-same-day-delivery-offers-free-shipping-112042013–finance.html, Amazon offers limited free shipping on same-day delivery orders. 2015.

Technological learning, energy consumption reduction, and environmental policies/regulations will have a great impact on the economic and environmental values of coal-to-olefin (CTO) projects. How should China configure its future olefin industry considering these factors? Little work has been performed to explore this question. This study develops a system optimization model to analyze the optimal configuration of China's olefin industry under different scenarios of technological learning, energy consumption reduction, and environmental policies/regulations. Our results show that in all scenarios, the oil-to-olefin process will remain dominant in China's olefin industry in the next two decades, and with technological learning, the CTO process is competitive in China's olefin industry, especially when CO2 emissions are not controlled. To control the CO2 emissions of China's olefin industry, our study indicates that requiring CTO implementation along with carbon capture and storage (CCS) would have both economic and environmental value compared with imposing a carbon tax (assume 20$/t CO2 from the year 2021). However, policymakers should be cautioned about the uncertainties and risks of CCS. This study also provides some insights for those who are considering investing in China's olefin industry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon tax; CCS; Energy consumption; Olefin industry; Technological learning","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Learning systems; Olefins; Optimization; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Carbon taxes; CO2 emissions; Environmental policy; Environmental values; Policy makers; System optimizations; Technological learning; Industrial economics; economic conditions; environmental economics; environmental policy; environmental values; learning; optimization; pollution tax; China","Boulamanti, A., Moya, J.A., Production costs of the chemical industry in the EU and other countries: ammonia, methanol and light olefins (2017) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 68 (2), pp. 1205-1212; Petrochemical and chemical industrial development planning 2016-2020, Ministry of industry and information technology of China (MIITC) (2016), https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/JEx572inUQdlbm-KGCK7MA, Available at: 318; BP statistical review of world energy 2013, BP technical report (2013), BP plc London; Xiang, D., Qian, Y., Yang, S.Y., Techno-economic analysis of the coal-to-olefins process in comparison with the oil-to-olefins process (2014) Appl Energy, 113, pp. 639-647; Amghizar, I., Vandewalle, L.A., Geem, K.V., Marin, G.B., New trends in olefin production (2017) Engineering, 2 (3), pp. 171-178; Ren, T., Patel, M.K., Basic petrochemicals from natural gas, coal and biomass: energy use and CO2 emissions (2009) Resour Conserv Recycl, 53 (9), pp. 513-528; Xiang, D., Yang, S., Mai, Z., Qian, Y., Comparative study of coal, natural gas, and coke-oven gas based methanol to olefins processes in China (2015) Comput Chem Eng, 83, pp. 176-185; Ren, T., Patel, M.K., Blok, K., Steam cracking and methane to olefins: energy use and CO2 emissions and production costs (2008) Energy, 33 (5), pp. 817-833; Zhang, Q., Hu, S., Chen, D., A comparison between coal-to-olefins and oil-based ethylene in China: an economic and environmental prospective [J] (2017) J Clean Prod, 165, pp. 1351-1360; Spallina, V., Velarde, I.C., Jimenez, J.A.M., Godini, H.R., Gallucci, F., Annaland, M.V.S., Techno-economic assessment of different routes for olefins production through the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM): advances in benchmark technologies (2017) Energy Convers Manag, 154, pp. 244-261; Van den Broek, M., Hoefnagels, R., Rubin, E., Turkenburg, W., Faaij, A., Effects of technological learning on future cost and performance of power plants with CO2 capture (2009) Prog Energ Combust, 35 (6), pp. 457-480; Jia, J., Huo, H., China coal-to-olefins thrives against low oil price (2016), http://www.sxcoal.com/news/4547817/info/en, Available at:; Tian, P., Wei, Y., Ye, M., Liu, Z., Methanol to olefins (MTO): from fundamentals to commercialization (2015) ACS Catal, 5 (3), pp. 1922-1938; Review and analysis of development opportunities of coal to olefins in China, China industry information web (CIIW) (2019), https://m.chyxx.com/view/707105.html/#m/https://www.chyxx, Available at:; Riahi, K., Rubin, E.S., Schrattenholzer, L., Prospects for carbon capture and sequestration technologies assuming their technological learning (2004) Energy, 29 (9-10), p. 1309; Rubin, E.S., Yeh, S., Antes, M., Berkenpas, M., Davison, J., Use of experience curves to estimate the future cost of power plants with CO2 capture (2007) Int.

We use structural decomposition analysis to find the relative contribution of five factors causing the changes in the energy and carbon embodied in exports. From 1996 to 2001, the changes in the direct energy efficiency, the structure of intermediate inputs and the structure of exports were the most important factors contributing to the changes of energy and carbon embodied in Taiwan's exports. Between 2001 and 2006, the structure of exports has been the most important factor causing the changes. This paper also explores whether energy policy could have effectively reduced the energy and carbon embodied in Taiwan's exports. Our results show imposing a carbon tax on using fossil fuels would have decreased the carbon embodied in exports only moderately from 1996 to 2001. However, the carbon embodied in exports would have decreased significantly from 2001 to 2006 after taxation, implying that a carbon tax would have been a more effective policy in the latter period. © 2018 National Taiwan University.

Nevertheless, efficiency improvements could spawn unintended rebound effects, which could offset the expected energy conservation and its associated CO2 reduction. This paper therefore intends to investigate the rebound effect in China's road transport system over the sample period 2003–2013. Utilizing a city-level dataset and a stochastic frontier rebound effect model, we found that there was considerable room to improve the fuel efficiency further in China's eight economic regions. Meanwhile, we also found the occurrence of rebound effects that the magnitudes of which ranged from ranged from 7.2% to 82.2%. The rebound magnitudes were shown to be negatively associated with the level of retail fuel prices, indicating that imposing carbon taxes might be a favorable way to downgrade the rebound effect. All these imply the necessity to design an appropriate policy that could facilitate efficiency improvements as well as attain CO2 reduction purpose. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions reduction capability; China's road transport system; Energy efficiency; Rebound effect; Stochastic frontier analysis","Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Efficiency; Emission control; Energy conservation; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Transportation; Carbon emissions reductions; Economic regions; Efficiency improvement; Fuel efficiency; Rebound effect; Road transport systems; Stochastic frontier; Stochastic frontier analysis; Energy efficiency; carbon emission; empirical analysis; energy efficiency; energy policy; pollution tax; price dynamics; road transport; stochasticity; China","Barla, P., Lamonde, B., Miranda-Moreno, L.F., Boucher, N., Traveled distance, stock and fuel efficiency of private vehicles in Canada: price elasticities and rebound effect (2009) Transportation, 36 (4), pp. 389-402; Bhattacharyya, S.C., Energy Economics, Concepts, Issues, Markets and Governance (2011), Springe Verlag London; BP, (2015), BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2015; Battese, G.E., Coelli, T.J., Frontier production functions, technical efficiency and panel data: with application to paddy farmers in India (1992) J.

This paper examines the World Trade Organization (WTO) consistency of a potential unilateral introduction of a carbon tax on imports to address perceived trade competitiveness concerns. The nature of the tax examined would aim to charge imported goods the equivalent of what their producers would have had to pay if the goods had been produced in the import- ing country. This paper argues that attempting to 'level the playing fi eld' by imposing a carbon tax on imports from countries with less stringent multilateral carbon reduction obligations would be contrary to the international recognition of 'common but differentiated responsibility' for climate change. By taking into account this principle in particular, reflected in the UN Climate Change Convention, a WTO panel may find in favour of a complainant against such a carbon tax under Article III of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 and also fi nd that the measure is not justifi ed under Article XX. © 2009 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",,"carbon emission; climate change; competitiveness; emission control; import; pollution policy; pollution tax; World Trade Organization",,,Article,Scopus

After a review for the literature reveals that there is no proper mix design procedure developed yet. GPC has better mechanical properties when compared to normal concrete. Curing conditions, setting times, workability, alkaline solution to binder ratios, molarity of alkaline solution, Na2SiO3/NaOH and SiO2/Al2O3 ratios play an important role to develop GPC. This paper presents an overview of Geopolymarization process, mechanical properties and mix design of GPC. Proper mix design of geopolymer concrete can produce desired mechanical properties for ambient curing condition. And geopolymer concrete can consider as eco-friendly construction material.

We use a bi-regional input-output analysis to look at how greenhouse gases in one region can be emitted as a result of demand in an exporting region. Looking at emissions generated throughout the island of Ireland, we find that emissions driven by demand in Northern Ireland are larger than those it generates, and vice-versa for the Republic of Ireland. We then use the input-output tables to simulate the effect of imposing a €15/tonne carbon tax in the Republic of Ireland. We find that this causes a decrease in final demand in the Republic of Ireland, and a decrease in output in both the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland; the decrease is greater in the Republic as the domestically produced share of inputs is much larger than the imported share in all sectors.","Bi-regional input-output analysis; Carbon tax; Greenhouse gas emissions; Northern Ireland; Republic of Ireland",,"Bacon, P., (1981) The Economics of Pollution: An Approach to a Quantitative Model for Ireland, , Unpublished PhD Thesis, Trinity College, Dublin; (2006) Supply and Use of Input-Output Table, , Central Statistic Office, Cork: Central Statistics Office; Chenery, H.B., Clark, P., Cao Pinna, V., (1953) The Structure and Growth of the Italian Economy, , Rome: U.S. Mutual Security Agency; (2005) Irish Submission to the United Nations framework convention on climate change, , Environmental Protection Agency, Johnstown Castle: Environmental Protection Agency; Hartwick, J.M., Notes on the Isard and Chenry-Moses Interregional Input-Output Models (1971) The Journal of Regional Science, 11 (1), pp. 73-86; Howley, M., Ó'Gallachóir, B., Dennehy, E., (2008) Energy in Ireland 1990-2007, , Report for Sustainable Energy Ireland, Cork: Sustainable Energy Ireland, Energy Policy Statistical Support Unit; Isard, W., Interregional and Regional Input-Output Analysis: A Model of Space-Economy (1951) The Review of Economics and Statistics, 33 (4), pp. 318-328; Labandeira, X., Labeaga, J.M., Combining Input-Output Analysis and Micro-Simulation to Assess the Effects of Carbon Taxation on Spanish Household (1999) Fiscal Studies, 20 (3), pp. 305-320; Leontief, W., (1941) The structure of the American economy 1919-1939: An empirical application of equilibrium analysis, , Oxford University Press; Leontief, W., Environmental Repercussions and the Economic Structure: An Input-Output Approach (1970) The Review of Economics and Statistics, 52 (3), pp. 262-271; Liang, Q., Fan, Y., Wei, Y., Multi-regional input-output model for regional energy requirements and CO2 emissions in China (2007) Energy Policy, 35 (3), pp. 1685-1700; Llop, M., Tol, R.S.J., (2011) Decomposition of Sectoral Greenhouse Gas Emissions: A Subsystem Input-Output Model for the Republic of Ireland, , ESRI Working Paper no. 398; Lyons, S., Mayor, K., Tol, R.S.J., Convergence of consumption patterns during macroeconomic transition: A model of demand in Ireland and the OECD (2009) Economic Modeling, 26 (3), pp. 702-714; Morgenroth, E., (2009) A Gravity Model Approach to Estimating the Expected Volume of North/South Trade, , Newry: InterTrade Ireland; Moses, L.N., The Stability of Interregional Trading Patterns and Input-Output Analysis (1955) American Economic Review, 45 (5), pp. 803-832; Okamoto, N., Sano, T., Inomata, S., (2005) Estimation Technique of International Input-Output Model by Non-Survey Method, , Institute of Developing Economies, Discussion Paper No. 28; O'Doherty, J., Tol, R.S.J., An Environmental Input-Output Model for Ireland (2007) The Economic and Social Review, 38 (2), pp. 157-190; Parikh, A., Forecasts of Input-Output Matrices Using the R.A.S.

Although there is a great deal of information available regarding mitigation strategies both in Australia and internationally, there seems to be a lack of research investigating the variable prices of carbon-based emissions on dairy farm operating profits in Australia. In this study, a stochastic analysis comparing the uncertainty in income in response to different prices on carbon-based emissions was conducted. The impact of variability in pasture consumption and variable prices of concentrates and hay on farm profitability was also investigated. The two different feeding systems examined were a ryegrass pasture-based system (RM) and a complementary forage-based system (CF). Imposing a carbon price ($20-$60) and not changing the systems reduced the farm operating profits by 28.4% and 25.6% in the RM and CF systems, respectively compared to a scenario where no carbon price was imposed. Different farming businesses will respond to variability in the rapidly changing operating environment such as fluctuations in pasture availability, price of purchased feeds and price of milk or carbon emissions differently. Further, in case there is a carbon price imposed for GHG emissions emanated from dairy farming systems, changing from pasture-based to more complex feeding systems incorporating home-grown double crops may reduce the reductions in farm operating profits. There is opportunity for future studies to focus on the impacts of different mitigation strategies and policy applications on farm operating profits. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon tax; Dairy; Feeding system; Operating profit; Stochastic dominance","carbon; analytical parameters; Article; Australia; carbon footprint; dairying; forage; pasture; priority journal; profit; stochastic model; Lolium","Alford, A.R., García, S.C., Farina, S., Fulkerson, W.J., (2009) An economic evaluation of the future dairy complementary forage rotation system - using cost budgeting, economic research, , Industry and Investment NSW, Armidale, NSW; Armstrong, D., Tarrant, K., Ho, C., Malcolm, L., Wales, W., Evaluating development options for a rain-fed dairy farm in Gippsland (2010) Anim.

We explore the problem from a central policymaker's perspective who wants to maximize social welfare. We consider two stakeholders, retailers, and consumers, who optimize their own objectives (i.e., profits and net utility) and three competitive settings (i.e., monopoly, monopolistic competition with symmetric market share, and monopolistic competition with asymmetric market share). For the monopoly case, we find that when the retailer's profit is high, imposing some carbon emission charges on the retailer and the consumers does not substantially change the supply chain structure or the social welfare. However, when the retailer's profit is low, imposing carbon costs optimally can lead to a significant increase in social welfare. Moreover, the impact of imposing carbon emission charges becomes more significant when the degree of competition increases. Additionally, the quantum of benefit may depend only on factors common across industries, such as fuel and carbon costs. © 2015 Production and Operations Management Society.","carbon tax; monopolistic competition; policy making; supply chain design; sustainability",,"(2013) United States History Map: Fifty States, , http://www.learner.org/interactives/historymap/fifty.html, Annerberg Learner (AL).

A strong majority of respondents believe that anthropogenic climate change is occurring and identify carbon dioxide emissions as a cause. Regression analysis shows that respondents recognize the effectiveness of direct actions that require difficult trade-offs, such as imposing a carbon tax. Yet, their voting intentions suggest a preference for policies that have at best an indirect effect on reducing climate change. Most respondents favor policy options that are generally good for the environment and cause no personal hardship. The disconnection between perceptions about the effectiveness of direct actions and support for less effective mitigation approaches may reflect the respondents' collective distancing from the problem of climate change. This could be an important consideration in the design of communication strategies that promote emission abatement policies. © The Author(s) 2012.","climate change; knowledge; mitigation options; policy support; risk perceptions","anthropogenic effect; carbon dioxide; climate change; emission control; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; information system; policy making; pollution tax; public attitude; regression analysis; risk perception; strategic approach; trade-off","Bauer, M.W., Allum, N., Miller, S., What can we learn from 25 years of PUS survey research?

One such reduction strategy proposed by the International Maritime Organization suggested imposing a carbon emission tax on ports as a long-term solution to reduce carbon emissions, but this would definitely increase the operating cost of ports. Quay cranes (QCs), as one type of handling equipment, play an important role in the service efficiency and carbon emission of ports. Therefore, this papermakes an effort to explore the study of the integrated berth allocation and QC assignment problem with the consideration of carbon emission taxation. This problem is formulated as a biobjective integer programming model, aimed atminimizing the total completion delay of all tasks and the total operating costs for all QCs. Finally, numerical experiments are performed to assess the applicability of the proposed models and evaluate the efficiency of the developed solution algorithm. © 2020 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

The model includes electricity trade between BC, Alberta and the US, the influence of a carbon emissions tax, contributions from the aging gas-fired Burrard Thermal plant and production from a proposed dam called ""Site C"" on the Peace River in northern BC. Model results suggest: If load increases as anticipated at 1.4%/year, BC will need to import significant amounts of electricity within two decades. Operating the Burrard plant at full capacity to 2025 and bringing Site C on line in 2020 delays the need to import by only 6 years, while realizing net electricity export sales of $5.9 billion by 2040. Bringing Site C on line but imposing a tax of $30/t of CO2 emitted on gas-fired generation causes immediate closure of the Burrard plant on economic grounds and reduces net export revenue to $0.63 billion by 2040. BC has options, however, including demand side management and development of additional generation capacity. In the absence of these measures, imported power may be more significant in BC's electricity future. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon tax; Energy planning; Hydroelectricity production","A-carbon; Alberta; British Columbia; Carbon taxes; Demand side managements; Electricity export; Electricity futures; Electricity system; Electricity trade; Energy planning; Energy-system models; Gas-fired; Gas-fired generation; Generation capacity; Hydroelectric reservoirs; Integrated management; Model results; Net exports; Thermal plants; Carbon dioxide; Plant shutdowns; Electricity; alternative energy; carbon emission; demand elasticity; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy planning; hydroelectric power; pollution tax; British Columbia; Burrard Inlet; Canada; Peace River","(2006), http://www.bchydro.com/about/sustainability/conservation/water_use_planning.html, BC Hydro.

Recently, many investigations have been done on supply chain model imposing carbon regulation policies. But the effect of inflation and time value of money are overlooked. Here, we extended our research by considering the concept of inflation and time value of money in fuzzy rough environment where the cost coefficients are taken as trapezoidal fuzzy rough variables. In order to obtain optimistic and pessimistic equivalent of fuzzy rough objective function we use fuzzy rough expectation operator based on trust measure theory. Optimal inventory replenishment policy is obtained by using 'interior point' algorithm in MATLAB R2013a and sensitivity analysis is also presented to explore the effect of changes in carbon tax, net discount rate of inflation and optimistic-pessimistic parameter on the optimal solution. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","emissions tax; fuzzy rough variable.; greenhouse gas emission; inflation; integrated supply chain; shipment",,"Banerjee, A., A joint economic lot size model for purchaser and vendor (1986) Decision Sciences, 17 (3), pp. 292-312; Bazan, E., Jaber, M.Y., Zanoni, S., Supply chain models with greenhouse gases emissions, energy usage and different coordination decisions (2015) Applied Mathematical Modelling, 39 (17), pp. 5131-5151; Bonney, M., Jaber, M.Y., Environmentally responsible inventory models: Non-classical models for a non-classical era (2011) International Journal of Production Economics, 133 (1), pp. 43-53; Bozorgi, A., Pazour, J., Nazzal, D., A new inventory model for cold items that considers costs and emissions (2014) International Journal of Production Economics, 155, pp. 114-125; Buzacott, J.A., Economic order quantities with inflation (1975) Operations Research Quarterly, 26 (3), pp. 553-558; Dubois, D., Prade, H., Ranking fuzzy numbers in the setting of possibility theory (1983) Information Sciences, 30 (3), pp. 183-224; Dubois, D., Prade, H., Possibility theory: Approach to computerized processing of uncertainty (1988) Plennm N, 4; Dubois, D., Prade, H., Rough fuzzy sets and fuzzy rough sets (1990) International Journal of General System, 17 (2-3), pp. 191-209; Fahimnia, B., Raeisi, M., Paksoy, T., Ozceylan, E., The implications of carbon pricing in Australia: An industrial logistics planning case study (2013) Transp.Res.D: Transp.Environ, 18, pp. 78-85; Fareeduddin, M., Hassan, A., Syed, M.N., Selim, S.Z., The impact of carbon policies on closed-loop supply chain network design (2015) Procedia CIRP, 26, pp. 335-340; Giri, B.C., Roy, B., A vendor-buyer integrated production-inventory model with quantity discount and unequal sized shipments (2013) Int.

Improved energy efficiency is an important strategy to achieve this goal. However, the rebound effect may act as a major obstacle to fully realizing the potential for energy savings. As one of three major energy consumption sectors in China, the construction industry is vital to reducing carbon emissions. This paper established a static computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to study the rebound effect of different energy sources used in the construction industry. The main energy sources used in the construction industry are coal, oil, natural gas, and electricity, and the conclusions show that the largest rebound effect was found for improvements in natural gas efficiency, with an average of 99.20%, while the lowest was for improvements in electricity efficiency, with an average of 83.47%. Moreover, the rebound effect of the primary energy sources (coal, oil, natural gas) was greater than the rebound effect of the secondary energy source (electricity). Our conclusions indicate that improving the energy efficiency in the construction industry will have a positive impact on GDP and on the mitigation of carbon emissions, and the presence of the rebound effect is significant, especially with regard to electricity sources. The implications of the results are that policymakers should primarily focus on improving the efficiency of electricity. In addition, this paper suggests that the rebound effect can be reduced by removing fossil fuel subsidies and imposing a carbon tax. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CGE model; Construction industry; Energy efficiency; Rebound effect","carbon emission; construction industry; electricity; emission control; energy efficiency; general equilibrium analysis; numerical model; policy making; pollution tax; China; carbon; carbon dioxide; coal; fossil fuel; building industry; China; electricity; environmental protection; productivity; trends; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Coal; Conservation of Natural Resources; Construction Industry; Efficiency; Electricity; Fossil Fuels","Allan, G., Gilmartin, M., McGregor, P.G., Swales, J.K., Turner, K., Modelling the economy-wide rebound effect (2009) Energy efficiency and sustainable consumption.

This question has challenged policy designers since the earliest programs imposing new prices on pollution, and remains a vital question today. This perspective offers insights on strategies for building greater political support for carbon pricing, based on previous experiences with long-running “auction and invest” programs in the U.S. and abroad, including the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), California's carbon pricing system, and the EU emissions trading system (ETS). Three key insights can be derived from those experiences. First: cap and trade with an auction of allowances is an important option for carbon pricing with distinctive advantages. Second, it is important to generate tangible public benefits from a carbon price that are distributed among citizens in a way that is broadly perceived as fair and addresses potential concerns about higher consumer costs for energy. Third, the most effective form of those public benefits should vary predictably across a few clearly defined categories according to local circumstances. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cap and trade; Carbon pricing; Climate change; Climate policy","Carbon; Climate change; Commerce; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; A-carbon; California; Cap and trade; Carbon pricing; Climate policy; EU Emissions Trading Systems; Political support; Costs; climate change; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental policy; European Union; governance approach; policy analysis; pollution tax; Europe; United States","Anderson, S.T., Marinescu, I.E., Shor, B., Can Pigou at the polls stop US melting the poles?

On the basis of current trends this requires a reduction of 10 million tonnes of carbon relative to baseline emissions. Earlier the UK Government had, in its White Paper on the Environment endorsed the use of market based instruments to achieve this objective. In the event the measures which were chosen included imposing VAT on domestic energy, increasing road-fuel duty as well as information campaigns and moral persuasion. The Government has stubbornly resisted the imposition of a European carbon energy tax ostensibly on the grounds of competitiveness. A carbon tax will undoubtedly be required if scientific evidence points to the need for greater cutbacks in Greenhouse emissions and may, contrary to expectation, increase both output and employment. -from Author",,"carbon emission; carbon tax; cost-benefit analysis; domestic energy; emission target; environmental economics; road-fuel duty; VAT; UK",,,Article,Scopus

This paper develops a method for estimating short-run zonal supply curves in transmission-constrained electricity markets that can be implemented quickly by policy analysts with training in statistical methods and with publicly available data. Our model enables analysis of distributional impacts of policies affecting operation of electric power grid. The method uses fuel prices and zonal electric loads to determine piecewise supply curves, identifying zonal electricity price and marginal fuel. We illustrate our methodology by estimating zonal impacts of Pennsylvania's Act 129, an energy efficiency and conservation policy. For most utilities in Pennsylvania, Act 129 would reduce the influence of natural gas on electricity price formation and increase the influence of coal. The total resulted savings would be around 267 million dollars, 82 percent of which would be enjoyed by the customers in Pennsylvania. We also analyze the impacts of imposing a $35/ton tax on carbon dioxide emissions. Our results show that the policy would increase the average prices in PJM by 47-89 percent under different fuel price scenarios in the short run, and would lead to short-run interfuel substitution between natural gas and coal. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon tax; Demand response policy; Electricity markets; Pennsylvania's Act 129; Transmission constraints; Zonal electricity supply curve","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Fuels; Global warming; Hydroelectric power; Natural gas; Carbon taxes; Demand response; Electricity market; Electricity supply; Pennsylvania; Transmission constraint; Costs; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; coal supply; electrical power; energy efficiency; energy market; fuel consumption; natural gas; policy analysis; pricing policy; Pennsylvania; United States","Masoud, A., Balancing market priorities with security issues (2004) IEEE Power Energy Mag, pp. 30-38; Valenzuela, J., Mazumdar, M., Aprobability model for the electricity price duration curve under oligopoly market (2005) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 20 (3), pp. 1250-1256; Amjady, N., Day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets by a new fuzzy neural network (2006) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 21 (2), pp. 887-896; An, N., Zhao, W., Wang, J., Shang, D., Zhao, E., Using multi-output feedforward neural network with empirical mode decomposition based signal filtering for electricity demand forecasting (2013) Energy, 49, pp. 279-288; Nogales, F.J., Conejo, A.J., Electricity price forecasting through transfer function models (2006) JOper Res Soc, 57, pp. 350-356; Amarawickrama, H.A., Hunt, L.C., Electricity demand for Sri Lanka: a time series analysis (2008) Energy, 33 (5), pp. 724-739; Pappas, S.S., Ekonomou, L., Karamousantas, D.C., Chatzarakis, G.E., Katsikas, S.K., Liatsis, P., Electricity demand loads modeling using auto regressive moving average (ARMA) models (2008) Energy, 33 (9), pp. 1353-1360; McLoughlin, F., Duffy, A., Conlon, M., Evaluation of time series techniques to characterize domestic electricity demand (2013) Energy, 50, pp. 120-130; Misiorek, A., Trueck, S., Weon, R., Point and interval forecasting of spot electricity prices: linear vs. non-linear time series models (2006) Stud Nonlinear Dyn Econ, 10 (3), pp. 1-36; Ruibal, C.M., Mazumdar, M., Forecasting the mean and the variance of electricity prices in deregulated markets (2008) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 23 (1), pp. 25-32; Holland, S.P., Mansur, E.T., The short-run effects of time-varying prices in competitive electricity markets (2006) Energy J, 27 (4), pp. 127-155; Apt, J., Blumsack, S.A., Lave, L.B., (2007) Competitive energy options for Pennsylvania, , http://wpweb2.tepper.cmu.edu/ceic/papers/Competitive_Energy_Options_for_Pennsylvania.htm, Report for the Team Pennsylvania Foundation, Available at:; Newcomer, A., Blumsack, S.A., Apt, J., Lave, L.B., Morgan, M.G., Short run effects of a price on carbon dioxide emissions from US electric generators (2008) Environ Sci Technol, 42 (9), pp. 3139-3144; Newcomer, A., Apt, J., Near-term implications of a ban on new coal-fired power plants in the United States (2009) Environ Sci Technol, 43 (11), pp. 3995-4001; Blumsack, S., Electric rate design and emissions reductions (2009) Proc. of IEEE Power and Energy Society general meeting, , Calgary, AB; Dowds, J., Hines, P., Farmer, C., Watts, R., Estimating the impact of electric vehicle charging on electricity costs given electricity-sector carbon cap (2010) JTransp Res Board, 2191 (1), pp. 43-49; Dowds, J., Hines, P., Blumsack, S., Estimating the impact of fuel-switching between liquid fuels and electricity under electricity-sector carbon-pricing schemes (2013) Socio-Econ Plan Sci, 47 (2), pp. 76-88; Borenstein, S., Bushnell, J.B., Wolak, F.A., Measuring market inefficiencies in California's restructured wholesale electricity market (2002) Am Econ Rev, 92 (5), pp. 1376-1404; Joskow, P., Kahn, E., (2001) Identifying the exercise of market power: refining the estimates, , Technical report; The emissions & generation resource integrated database (eGRID), , http://www.epa.gov/egrid, Available at:; Fisk, J.M., The right to know?

An alternative toward sustainable production",2019,"Journal of Cleaner Production","10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.117988","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070698612&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2019.117988&partnerID=40&md5=48289ddf73d1a32b75500a04543cef22","Remanufacturing has attracted much attention in recent years because of its potential to achieve sustainable production. Due to low consumer acceptance, however, the market size of remanufactured products remains small. There are different ways to promote remanufacturing, two of which being providing cash subsidy and imposing carbon regulation. Cash subsidy demonstrates the direct role of governments in promoting consumption of specific products, whereas carbon regulation indirectly promotes the manufacture of low-emission products through mandatory measures. In this paper, we study how these two intervention policies affect the demand for remanufactured products, firm profit and social welfare, taking total carbon emissions into consideration. We model a monopoly firm that sells both new and remanufactured products to capture the economic and environmental impacts of these policies. By comparing the two policies, we derive the closed form of regions or intervals that indicate which policy incurs higher remanufacturing output or lower total emission. Important findings obtained include: (1) The two policies may have different impacts on recycling economy – remanufacturing subsidy increases the consumption of remanufactured products, and this indicates that more obsolete products are collected and remanufactured; whereas carbon regulation only works when the remanufacturing acceptance level is high enough or when the unit carbon emission of remanufactured products is low enough. (2) Remanufacturing subsidy promotes profit, however, carbon regulation might hurt the firm's profit. On consumer surplus and social welfare, both policies show uncertain trends. (3) On the total carbon emission, a mandatory carbon tax can help to decrease it. However, remanufacturing subsidy works only when the remanufacturing acceptance level is high enough or when the unit carbon emission of new products is large enough. © 2019","Carbon regulation; Environmental performance; Remanufacturing subsidy; Social welfare; Sustainability","Carbon; Economic and social effects; Environmental management; Environmental regulations; Profitability; Sustainable development; Carbon regulations; Consumer acceptance; Environmental performance; Obsolete products; Remanufactured products; Remanufacturing subsidy; Social welfare; Sustainable production; Environmental impact","Aksen, D., Aras, N., Karaarslan, A.G., Design and analysis of government subsidized collection systems for incentive-dependent returns (2009) Int.

Large budget deficits, rising national debt, and the growth of entitlement spending have raised questions regarding fiscal sustainability in the United States. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicts a FY2011 budget deficit of nearly $1.5 trillion, or 9.8% of gross domestic product (GDP). Over the past three decades, budget deficits have averaged 3% of GDP. Large budget deficits have contributed to an increased level of federal debt, relative to the size of the economy. Increased debt levels are expected to lead to increased federal interest payments. If not addressed, the current fiscal situation could undermine economic growth. Reducing federal deficits will likely require reductions in spending, increased federal revenues, or some combination of spending cuts and revenue increases. Federal revenues in 2009 and 2010, relative to the size of the economy, were low by historical standards. Reduced federal collections may be partially attributable to the weak economy and the fiscal policy response. Historically low individual income tax collections may also be partially explained by the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. Spending through the tax code, via tax expenditures, also reduces federal revenues. The use of tax expenditures may undermine economic efficiency and equity in the tax code. The primary sources of federal revenues are individual income taxes, payroll taxes, corporate income taxes, and excise taxes. Additional income tax revenues could be raised with a broader tax base, which could be achieved by eliminating various exemptions, credits, and deductions. A broader tax base could also allow for lowerAax rates, without a loss in federal revenues. Broadening the tax base could enhance the economic efficiency of the tax system. There are other options for generating additional revenues outside of the current tax system. The federal government could raise revenues through additional consumption taxes, excise taxes, or by imposing a tax on carbon. The President's Fiscal Commission and the Debt Reduction Task Force took different approaches in the tax reform components of their fiscal sustainability plans. The President's Fiscal Commission raised additional tax revenues primarily through comprehensive income tax reform. The Fiscal Commission chose to broaden the tax base, allowing for both lower tax rates and increased federal revenues. The Debt Reduction Task Force's proposal also recommended individual income tax reform. The individual income tax reforms recommended by the Debt Reduction Task Force were designed to enhance efficiency and increase progressivity in the income tax system. Additional revenues in the Debt Reduction Task Force's plan originate from the proposed 6.5% debt-reduction sales tax. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,"(2011) The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2011 to 2021, , http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12039/01-26_FY201lOutlook.pdf, Washington, DC, January; Toder, E., Turner, M.A., Lim, K., (2010) Reforming the Mortgage Interest Deduction, Urban Institute and Tax Policy Center, , http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/uploadedpdf/412099-mortgage-deduction-reform, April; (2009) Budget Options, 2, pp. 234-235. , Washington, DC, August; Perry, I.W.H., Small, K., Does Britain or the United States Have the Right Gasoline Tax (2005) The American Economic Review, 95 (4), pp. 1276-1289. , September; Toder, E., Rosenberg, J., (2010) Effects of Imposing a Value-Added Tax to Replace Payroll Taxes or Corporate Taxes, , http://taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedPDF/412062_VAT.pdf, Tax Policy Center, Washington , DC, March 18; Brownell, K.D., Farley, T., Willett, W.C., The Public Health and Economic Benefits of Taxing Sugar-Sweetened Beverages (2009) The New England Journal of Medicine, 361 (16), pp. 1599-1605. , October 15","Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",Book Chapter,Scopus

China, whose population is more than 20% of the world population, is the 2nd biggest electricity consumption country of the world in 1999. The environmental problem related to energy consumption in China, which cannot be ignored, is that the huge amount of coal is used as an energy source. As the carbon content per unit calorific value in coal is 30% higher than in oil, therefore the carbondioxide emissions has increased, which is the main factor for global warming. The contents of the paper include four parts: the literature review and objective, quantitative analysis of carbon tax in China while considering the introduction of a green energy (wind power and solar power), conclusion and policy proposal, and future works. In this paper, we propose a policy mix, imposing carbon tax in China for CO2 emission curtailment and introducing the green energy. The main point of this paper is to form a carbon management policy that will lead to greening of the existing energy system in China, using our multi-sectoral macro-economical model including I-O table, then we derive the optimum carbon tax rate endogenously by running simulation model under CO2 emission restrictions. © 2003, JAPAN SECTION OF THE REGIONAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL.

We argue that the strategic component is inconsistent with commitments under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). We extend the theory of border adjustments to neutralize the strategic incentive, and consider the remaining environmental incentive in a simplified structure. The theory supports border adjustments on carbon content that are below the domestic carbon price, because price signals sent through border adjustments inadvertently encourage consumption of emissions intensive goods in unregulated regions. The theoretic intuition is supported in our applied numeric simulations. Countries imposing border adjustments at the domestic carbon price will be extracting rents from unregulated regions at the expense of efficient environmental policy and consistency with international trade law. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Border tax adjustments; Carbon leakage; Climate policy; Trade and carbon taxes","Carbon; Environmental protection; International trade; Border tax adjustments; Carbon leakage; Carbon taxes; Climate policy; Environmental policy; General agreement on tariffs and trades; International trade law; Numeric simulation; Environmental regulations; environmental economics; environmental policy; GATT; international trade; pollution tax; strategic approach; trade-environment relations","Aldy, J.E., Stavins, R.N., Designing the post-kyoto climate regime: Lessons from the harvard project on international climate agreements (2008) Report, Harvard Kennedy School, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, , November; Aldy, J.E., Orszag, P.R., Stiglitz, J.E., (2001) Climate change: An agenda for global collective action, , Conference Paper, Pew Center on Global Climate Change, October; Allen, D., (2010) OECD Global Forum on Environment Focusing on Sustainable Materials Management: Materials Case Study 2: Aluminum.

Standard policies are failing to manage the systemic risk of dangerous-to-catastrophic climate change for a variety of reasons. In this chapter we clarify and expand on a market hypothesis that argues for a second externalized cost of carbon, called the Risk Cost of Carbon (RCC), as the appropriate solution to this risk problem. The combination of the SCC and RCC creates a new paradigm of complementary market pricing for the dual objectives of improving market efficiency and managing systemic risk, respectively. Introducing the RCC addresses the problem of how to decouple gross world product (GWP) from carbon emissions and how to solve the paradox of time discounting under systemic risk. Subsequently the RCC could have major implications for climate change economics, public policy, and sustainability theory. The hypothesis is novel by taking into consideration both the entropy and the mass of the carbon budget. The RCC is technically defined as the cost of imposing risk tolerances (%) on climate mitigation objectives, and it has units of USD per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) mitigated. The RCC is internalized with a “global carbon reward” that manages a trade-off between market efficiency and climate certainty. The carbon reward is issued as a parallel currency and with an exchange rate that is managed by central banks over a rolling 100-year planning horizon. A key recommendation is to test the hypothesis with experiments. © The Author(s) 2019.","Biophysical; Carbon price; Central bank; Climate change; Entropy; Macroprudential; Monetary policy; Parallel currency; Risk management; Systemic risk; Thermodynamics","Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Economic and social effects; Economics; Efficiency; Emission control; Entropy; Public policy; Risk management; Thermodynamics; Biophysical; Carbon price; Central bank; Macroprudential; Monetary policies; Parallel currency; Systemic risks; Climate change","Aglietta, M., Espagne, E., (2016) Climate and finance systemic risks, more than an analogy?

Environmental risks are associated with specific costs and expenditures necessary to mitigate their negative effects. In this context, the financial system plays a significant role, particularly the public financial system, which allocates and redistributes public resources and has an impact on market participants by imposing environmental taxes. This study assessed the interdependence between environmental degradation and public expenditure, financial sector development, environmental taxes, and related socioeconomic policies. The aim was to diagnose and define the relationship between environmental degradation and sustainable fiscal instruments used in the financial system. The original research approach adopted in the study is the inclusion of variables representing a sustainable approach to assessment of the financial system. Two groups of European Union countries were analyzed for the period 2008–2017, namely, converging economies from Central and Eastern Europe and the largest developed economies of Western Europe. The authors found a strong relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and fiscal instruments, especially expenditure on research and development, and the development of the financial sector. In the case of environmental taxes, their impact differed depending on the country, being predominantly beneficial in countries with higher greenhouse gas emissions but unfavorable in countries with lower emissions levels. © 2020 by the authors.

While the role played in this process by fiscal and industry policies (e.g. carbon taxes and other market-based incentives) is well understood (even if not pursued currently in Australia), the potentially powerful leverage to be exercised by trade policy is under-recognised. There are some positive developments such as a proposed Environmental Goods Agreement being discussed in Geneva, while there are negative developments embodied in various bilateral and regional trade agreements such as the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, to which Australia has committed itself. There are rising levels of conflict over trade and climate change mitigation measures, in actions brought at the WTO against countries looking to promote green industries through measures like local content requirements being attached to foreign direct investment, or by countries imposing border tax adjustments against exporters who allegedly fail to implement carbon taxes. The issues involved are discussed in this paper and possible ways forward are proposed, along with some implications for Australia. © 2015 Australian Institute of International Affairs.","border tax adjustments; environmental goods agreement; green trade; local content requirements","climate change; environmental economics; incentive; pollution tax; sustainable development; trade agreement; trade performance; trade policy; trade-environment relations; World Trade Organization; Australia; China; India","Cosbey, A., (2013) Green Industrial Policy and the World Trading System, Entwined Issue Brief #17.” International Institute for Sustainable Development., , http://www.iisd.org/publications/green-industrial-policy-and-world-trading-system; Cosbey, A., Mavroidis, P.C., A Turquoise Mess: Green Subsidies, Blue Industrial Policy and Renewable Energy: The Case for Redrafting the Subsidies Agreement of the WTO (2014) Journal of International Economic Law, 17 (1), pp. 11-47; Drysdale, P., Armstrong, S., International and Regional Cooperation: Asia's Role and Responsibilities International and Regional Cooperation (2010) Asian Economic Policy Review, 5 (2), pp. 157-173; Du, M., The Case against China's Joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership (2015) Transnational Dispute Management, 1. , http://www.transnational-dispute-management.com/article.asp?key=2170; Hestermeyer, H.P., Nielsen, L., The Legality of Local Content Measures under WTO Law (2014) Journal of World Trade, 48 (3), pp. 553-591; Howse, R., (2010) Climate Mitigation Subsidies and the WTO Legal Framework: A Policy Analysis, , Winnipeg, MA: International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD); Hu, A., (2006) Green Development: The Inevitable Choice for China (Part 1), China Dialogue., , http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/134; Jha, V., India's Twin Concerns over Energy Security and Climate Change: Revisiting India's Investment Treaties through a Sustainable Development Lens (2013) Trade, Law and Development, 5 (1), pp. 109-149; Kuntze, J.-C., Moerenhout, T., (2013) Local Content Requirements and the Renewable Energy Industry: A Good Match, , Geneva: International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development/Seoul: Global Green Growth Institute; Leal-Arcas, R., (2013) Working Together: How to make Trade Contribute to Climate Action.

Carbon tariff has brought about new trade barriers of developed countries, and in order to enhance the industrial competitiveness of developed countries, it will produce unfavorable impact on developing countries. Concentrated on the manufacturing industry, which is the most intensive high-carbon industry in China’s export structure, this article studies the relationship between carbon tariff policy and industry structure of export trade and builds up a relation between climate change and international trade. First, by means of establishing a partial equilibrium model, it applies geometric analysis and mathematical analysis to compute the impact on China’s manufacturing export trade and the consequences of the introduction of the US carbon tariff to China’s manufacturing industry that has already imposed a domestic shipping carbon tax. Furthermore, with the application of the GTAP model, it estimates the overall economic and welfare effects on China’s manufacturing industry if the US and Europe introduce carbon tariff by means of four ways, and then analyzes the influence on China’s manufacturing industry export structure and social welfare as well. The result shows that the introduction of the US carbon import tariff lowers China’s export price and export volume, and the implementation of a domestic carbon tax justifies a higher export price and a lower export volume for China. However, the degree of export reduction is smaller than that under the effect of the US carbon tariff. In the case of developed countries imposing carbon tariff on China’s energy-intensive industries, such as chemical rubber products, oil and coal-processing industry and paper industry, whose export would be reduced, the negative impact on the paper industry is the severest, which will decrease the paper industry’s export ranging from 1.79% to 6.05%, whereas the other industries’ export will increase. Anyhow, it will promote China’s manufacturing industry to adjust the export structure to a certain extent. In addition, it will lead to a decrease in China’s welfare, with a decrease between $2.134 billion and $8.347 billion. Finally, this paper provides information on international coordination, export structure adjustment and green manufacturing adjustment as a reference for the development of China’s manufacturing industry. © 2015 Shandong Normal University.","Carbon tariff; Export structure; GTAP model; Manufacturing industry; Social welfare",,"Babiker, M.H., Climate change policy, market structure, and carbon leakage (2005) J Int Econ, 65, pp. 421-445; Daniel, G., (2009) Global welfare implications of carbon border taxes, pp. 1-26. , CESifo Working Paper, (2790); Dong, Y., Whalley, J., (2009) How large are the impacts of carbon motivated border tax adjustments?, pp. 1-37. , NBER Working Paper; Dong, Y., Whalley, J., Carbon motivated regional trade arrangements: Analytics and simulations (2011) Econ Model, 28, pp. 2783-2792; Everett, B., Joachim, S., (2007) Economic and environmental effects of border tax adjustments, pp. 1-36. , Working Paper Sustainability and Innovation; Hubler, M., (2009) Can carbon based import tariffs effectively reduce carbon emissions?, pp. 1-26. , Kiel Working Paper, (1565); Manders, T., Veenendaal, P., Border tax adjustments and the EU-ETS--A quantitative assessment (2008) CPB Document, 171, pp. 1-36; Qu, R.X., Wu, J., Study on welfare effects of carbon tariffs (2011) China Population, Resour Environ, 4, pp. 37-42; Shen, K.T., Li, G., The impacts of carbon-motivated border tax adjustment to China's industrial exports-a CGE based analysis (2010) Finance & Trade Econ, 1, pp. 75-82; Springmann, M., A look inwards: Carbon tariffs versus internal improvements in emissions-trading systems. 2011 (2012) Ger Inst Econ Res, 34, pp. 228-239; Wang, Y.X., Influence of carbon tariff on China's export and national welfare: An empirical research based on China-US trade and tariff data (2013) J Int Trade, 7, pp. 119-127; Warwick, J., Peter, J., (2008) The economic and environmental effects of border tax adjustments for climate policy, pp. 1-37. , Brookings Institution; Yang, L.Q., Ma, M., GTAP simulation analysis of the effects of carbon tariffs on Chinese export trade (2011) J Shanghai Univ Finance Econ, 5, pp. 75-81","Taylor and Francis Ltd.",Article,Scopus

We show that the Doha Round proposals for a new agreement on agriculture through the World Trade Organization would not generate significant reductions in emissions. Further trade liberalization would reduce emissions by cutting agricultural production but would not change production methods. Imposing a carbon tax would lead both to a reduction in output and the extensification of production. In contrast, if farmers are allowed to claim a credit for carbon sequestration the effect is to intensify agricultural production. © The Author 2015.","Domestic policy; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Trade policy",,"Anderson, K., Blackhurst, R., Trade, the Environment and Public Policy (1992) The Greening of World Trade Issues, pp. 3-22. , ed.

That is to say, it is quite possible that we cannot solve the North-South problem while at the same time containing global warming and conserving fossil fuels. But this paper attempts to show that, on the contrary, the fast development of these countries might very well bring about a long-term solution of the global warming problem. A model incorporating development stage theory is built and used to calculate by region the world's economic growth, population growth, energy supply and demand, CO2 emissions and other items up to the end of the 21st century. Results indicated that if in 2100 world population is about 10 billion (it was 5.1 billion in 1990), world GDP is US$200 trillion (1987 prices; it was US$20 trillion in 1990) and CO2 emissions are 10 billion tonnes (carbon equivalent; they were 5.8 billion tonnes in 1990), there will be fairly good prospects for solving the North-South, fossil fuel exhaustion and global warming problems.

In recent years, concerns about the effects those emissions might have on the climate have prompted Congress, federal regulators, and others to consider policies to reduce them. This book examines the unintended effects on the competitiveness of U.S firms of an economywide policy, such as a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade program, that would reduce emissions by imposing a price on them. The book also assesses the use of border adjustments, such as import tariffs and export subsidies, and transition assistance to mitigate those unintended effects. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The evaluation of the effectiveness of such policies, however, is fragmented, which raises a need for a comprehensive analysis. This paper aims to assess whether and how policies promoting renewable energy investment have achieved the intended goals. It employs five broadly defined criteria - market, uncertainty, profitability, technology, and financial resources - to build an index to assess respectively if such policies have helped create a market for renewable energy, maximize potential profits, reduce risks relating to the investment, develop and adopt new technologies, and improve the access to financial resources. Each criterion is reflected by three indicators. Values of each indicator are converted into ordinal values for analysis. The index not only scans comprehensively all relevant renewable energy investment policies in the East Asia Summit countries, but also provides systematic and quantitative measures to compare the effectiveness of policies in these countries with respect to the creation of market, the degree of uncertainty, the potential of profitability, the development and adoption of technology and the accessibility of financial resources. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","East Asia Summit countries; Policy evaluation; Renewable energy investment","Carbon; Commerce; Finance; Laws and legislation; Profitability; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Risk assessment; Technology transfer; Uncertainty analysis; Comprehensive analysis; East Asia; Policy evaluation; Power purchase agreement; Quantitative assessments; Renewable energy development; Renewable energy investments; Renewable energy policy; Investments; alternative energy; energy policy; finance; investment; policy analysis; quantitative analysis; renewable resource; Far East","Bakhtyar, B., Sopian, K., Zaharim, A., Salleh, E., Lim, C.H., Potentials and challenges in implementing feed-in tariff policy in Indonesia and the Philippines (2013) Energy Policy, 60, pp. 418-423; Barradale, M.J., Impact of public policy uncertainty on renewable energy investment: Wind power and the production tax credit (2010) Energy Policy, 38 (12), pp. 7698-7709; Blok, K., Renewable energy policies in the European Union (2006) Energy Policy, 34 (3), pp. 251-255; Bloomberg New Energy Finance, 2015.

This paper analyses the economic costs and benefits of imposing a global carbon tax on international bunker emissions by employing a computable general equilibrium model approach. Under the assumption of an emissions reduction of 5% below 2000 levels by 2020, we demonstrate that a global bunker emissions charge, on one hand, reduces trade volume and change trade patterns between countries and regions, while on the other hand, accelerates the adoption of energy-saving technologies and reallocates the supply of international transportation services throughout the world. The net economic impact, though negative on average, is modest compared to the benefits obtained from the emissions reduction. If revenues from a bunker emissions charge are properly distributed among countries and regions, the losses to disadvantaged countries are likely to be offset by the benefits to advantaged countries. This finding provides useful insights for policy-makers: a global bunker emissions charge could, in future, be an economically feasible strategy to reduce the increasing bunker emissions through the implementation requires more political effort and wisdom. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Bunker emissions charge; CGE model; Economic and trade impact; International maritime transport","Commerce; Emission control; Energy conservation; Bunker emissions charge; CGE model; Computable general equilibrium model; Economic costs and benefits; Emissions reduction; Energy-saving technologies; Maritime transport; Transportation services; Economic and social effects; carbon emission; economic impact; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; maritime transportation; policy making; pollution tax","Abrell, J., Regulating CO2 emissions of transportation in Europe: a CGE-analysis using market-based instruments (2000) Transp.

We analyzed the public policy aimed at forest conservation for preservation of water supply sources with an environmental tax on forest destruction. We supposed the quality of the water depends on the preservation of the water source affected by forest conservation. Furthermore, we assumed that consumption activities of residents have negative external effects on forest conservation. Local governments adopt different financing methods for environment conservation, because they cannot arrive at an agreement on the principle of cost burden. In Toyota city, an additional rate for water is imposed on residents to finance investments for forest conservation and secure high quality water, because all residents are the beneficiaries of the high quality water. It is common for the consumption activities of residents to directly or indirectly destroy the environment through the production activities of firms producing consumption goods. Imposing taxes on consumption is justified by the polluter-pays principle (PPP). In this paper, we examine three schemes to finance the costs of the public investment for forest conservation; (i) general taxes (lump sum tax), (ii) additional rate for the water supply, (iii) consumption taxes. A model of the long-run optimal problems of investments for forest conservation is constructed, where each level of investment is compared according to the financing scheme. The following conclusions were made; (1) all three schemes cannot achieve the optimal resource allocation of consumption goods, water supply and investments for forest conservation, (2) the lump sum taxation scheme achieves an efficient investment for forest protection, but cannot resolve the distortion due to negative external effects of consumption, and (3) the consumption tax scheme can improve the distortion effects of consumption by raising the price of consumption, (4) the consumption tax scheme can achieve the optimal level of consumption. Although we cannot rank each scheme on the basis of its efficiency, it appears the second scheme has merit because people want to protect the forests to secure water resources and are willing to pay the costs. © 2009, JAPAN SECTION OF THE REGIONAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL.

However, CO2 sequestration is not a perfect substitute for CO2 abatement because CO2 may leak back into the atmosphere (thus imposing future climate change impacts) and because CO 2 sequestration requires energy (thus producing more CO2 and depleting fossil fuel resources earlier). Here we use analytical and numerical models to assess the economic efficiency of CO2 sequestration and analyze the optimal timing and extent of CO2 sequestration. The economic efficiency factor of CO2 sequestration can be expressed as the ratio of the marginal net benefits of sequestering CO2 and avoiding CO2 emissions. We derive an analytical solution for this efficiency factor for a simplified case in which we account for CO2 leakage, discounting, the additional fossil fuel requirement of CO2 sequestration, and the growth rate of carbon taxes. In this analytical model, the economic efficiency of CO2 sequestration decreases as the CO2 tax growth rate, leakage rates and energy requirements for CO2 sequestration increase. Increasing discount rates increases the economic efficiency factor. In this simple model, short-term sequestration methods, such as afforestation, can even have negative economic efficiencies. We use a more realistic integrated-assessment model to additionally account for potentially important effects such as learning-by-doing and socio-economic inertia on optimal strategies. We measure the economic efficiency of CO2 sequestration by the ratio of the marginal costs of CO2 sequestration and CO2 abatement along optimal trajectories. We show that the positive impacts of investments in CO2 sequestration through the reduction of future marginal CO2 sequestration costs and the alleviation of future inertia constraints can initially exceed the marginal sequestration costs. As a result, the economic efficiencies of CO2 sequestration can exceed 100% and an optimal strategy will subsidize CO2 sequestration that is initially more expensive than CO2 abatement. The potential economic value of a feasible and acceptable CO2 sequestration technology is equivalent - in the adopted utilitarian model - to a one-time investment of several percent of present gross world product. It is optimal in the chosen economic framework to sequester substantial CO2 quantities into reservoirs with small or zero leakage, given published estimates of marginal costs and climate change impacts. The optimal CO2 trajectories in the case of sequestration from air can approach the pre-industrial level, constituting geoengineering. Our analysis is silent on important questions (e.g., the effects of model and parametric uncertainty, the potential learning about these uncertainties, or ethical dimension of such geoengineering strategies), which need to be addressed before our findings can be translated into policy-relevant recommendations. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Atmospheric chemistry; Climate change; Economic analysis; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Reduction; Carbon dioxide sequestration; Economic efficiency; Carbon dioxide; anthropogenic effect; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; concentration (composition); economic impact; efficiency measurement; environmental policy; fossil fuel; numerical model","Adam, D., Royal society disputes value of carbon sinks (2001) Nature, 412, p. 108; Adger, N., Aggarwal, P., Agrawala, S., Alcamo, J., Allali, A., Anisimov, O., Arnell, N., Yohe, G., (2007) Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, Summary for Policymakers, , IPCC Secretariat, c/o WMO, 7bis, Avenue de la Paix, C.P.

Could life cycle assessment (LCA) of petroleum oil products provide inputs to crude oil sourcing and domestic oil pricing policies to address the two concerns? This paper presents a baseline study on LCA of petroleum products in India from Well to Storage depending on the oil source, type of refinery, product and the selected destinations. The LCA based GHG emissions are found to be higher by 4-12 per cent than GHG emissions from direct fuel consumption alone for LPG, 7-10 per cent for Gasoline, 3-9 per cent for Diesel and 4-10 per cent for Kerosene based on various supply chain routes supplying oil to six largest cities in India. Overall the energy used in oil exploration, refinery and transportation in the LCA have a share of 72-77 per cent, 11-15 per cent and 6-8 per cent, respectively. The paper proposes imposing a relative carbon cess for various oil products in different Indian cities. States could accommodate this additional carbon cess by reducing their respective state taxes without increasing the final delivery price to the consumers. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle assessment; Petroleum products","Baseline studies; Household sectors; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions; Oil exploration; Oil import dependences; Policy discussion; Pricing policy; Carbon; Climate change; Crude oil; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Kerosene; Oil wells; Petroleum products; Petroleum refineries; Petroleum transportation; Refining; Supply chains; Life cycle; crude oil; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; hydrocarbon exploration; life cycle analysis; oil supply; petroleum; price dynamics; pricing policy; tax system; India","Brand, C., Tran, M., Anable, J., The UK transport carbon model: an integrated life cycle approach to explore low carbon futures (2012) Energy Policy, 41, pp. 107-124. , Feb 2012; Brinkman, N., Wang, M., Weber, T., Darlington, T., Full fuel cycle assessment: well-to-wheels energy inputs (2005), http://www.transportation.anl.gov, emissions and water impacts.

Competing land uses have not favored conservation during the last several decades and therefore the need for an effective public policy instrument to curtail forest loss is evident. Approach: This article analyzed a policy intended to augment the funds for subsidizing forest conservation in Costa Rica through a tax on the consumption of potable water. This potable water canon was compared on the basis of legitimacy criteria to the alternative of imposing a tax on the exploitation of marginal lands. The analysis was based on comparing the perceptions different stakeholders have toward deforestation and its potential solutions, which result into different frames, or views regarding the problem. The perceptions were obtained from semi-structured interviews of individuals representing the central and local governments, national and local non-governmental organizations, the private sector, academia and political parties. Results: Overall, the water canon is a superior policy from the point of view of technical implementability and political feasibility. The regulation was expected to increase the forest cover in private hands in a more effective way than the tax on marginal lands, while keeping government expenditures to a minimum. The policy context is one of high expert and social trust and low government trust, requiring substantive stakeholder education and the creation of feedback mechanisms to increase acceptability during the implementation period. Conclusion: If approved by the Costa Rican Congress, the water canon will become an innovative conservation policy from which other developing countries will be able to obtain valuable lessons. © 2009 Science Publications.","Conservation policy; Costa Rica; Deforestation; Subsidies","carbon sequestration; conservation planning; deforestation; drinking water; ecosystem service; environmental education; forest cover; forest management; policy analysis; policy implementation; soil conservation; subsidy system; tax system; tropical forest; tropical region; water storage; Central America; Costa Rica","Andrade, Z., (2004) Tiquicia Reinvents Itself La Nación; Legislativa, A., (2005) Law of the Hyrological Resource, , Unpublished document, San José, Costa Rica; Brockett, C.D., Gottfried, R.R., State policies and the preservation of forest cover: Lessons from contrasting public-policy regimes in Costa Rica.

It is an effective measure of reducing the emissions produced by auxiliary engines of ships at berth. This paper develops a cooperative optimization method to model the problem of whether to allocate shore power for each berth and which berth is allocated for the stochastic arriving ship. The cooperative optimization method is to minimize the total cost of installing and using shore power systems and maximize the environmental benefit of reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Considering the emission of different pollutants can't be directly accumulated as the objective, different pollutants are uniformly expressed as economic penalties by imposing environmental taxes and then economic penalties are regarded as the objective of environmental benefits. Firstly, the problem is carried out by proposing a multi-objective cooperative optimization model from the perspective that both shipping and port companies take overall benefits of port supply chains as the optimization target. Next, the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to resolve the model. Then, a proposed bulk terminal/wharf is taken as an example to conduct experiments for gaining optimal solutions under different carbon pricing policy scenarios. After then, based on the proposed preference-based decision-making method, optimal decisions under different preference are obtained. Finally, in order to analyze the applicability and generalizability of the model, experiments are conducted to analyze the impact of environmental tax rates on results and berthing time on environmental benefits. The results show that optimal solutions can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur oxides, nitrous oxides and particulate matters by at least 3.8% while reducing the total cost by 35.9%, compared with the baseline scheme. Meanwhile optimal solutions can reduce emissions by up to 100%, but increase the total cost by 183.7%. Besides, the proposed model has good applicability when the berthing time and environmental tax rates change. In conclusion, the developed method can be widely used for popularizing shore power, promoting port sustainable development, reducing global air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Berth allocation; Cooperative optimization; Green port; Shore power allocation; Sustainable development","Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Emission control; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Multiobjective optimization; Nitrogen oxides; Optimal systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Ships; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Sulfur dioxide; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Taxation; Transfer cases (vehicles); Cooperative optimization; Cooperative optimization models; Decision-making method; Effective measures; Electricity demands; Environmental benefits; Environmental taxes; Multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithms; Cost reduction","Abdullah, M., Al-Muta'a, E.A., Al-Sanabani, M., Integrated MOPSO algorithms for task scheduling in cloud computing (2019) J.

The emissions paper explains that emissions trading is a more flexible market-based policy tool than imposing a carbon tax on industry. The paper further explains explicitly that any solution to the problem must be achieved at the lowest possible costs to the economy, on the understanding that trading will have fewer repercussions for fossil fuel and energy generating industries. Alternative schemes have been suggested for the paper with some highlighting that end-user efficiency and mandating of renewable generation limits have already begun to improve carbon efficiency.

Using a detailed economic model we examine the implications of imposing a tax on GHG emissions from Norwegian agriculture under a continuation of existing agricultural policies. We find that this would result in a reduction of agricultural production, particularly for GHG-intensive commodities such as beef and sheepmeat. The use of feed and fertiliser would fall. There would be an extensification of production and emissions per hectare would decline. In contrast, if farmers are rewarded for carbon sequestration through agro-forestry, this would lead to intensification. More inputs would be applied to land that remained in agriculture and emissions per unit of agricultural land would increase. Although the numerical results are specific to the Norwegian setting, they are illustrative of global issues. If agriculture is to meet the needs of an expanding world population while simultaneously contributing to mitigation of GHG emissions, this will require the intensification of production - higher output per unit of land with higher emissions per unit of land area, but with lower emissions per unit of agricultural production. © 2013 The Agricultural Economics Society and the European Association of Agricultural Economists.",,"agricultural emission; agricultural policy; agricultural production; agroforestry; carbon sequestration; emission control; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; Gross Domestic Product; pollution tax; Norway","Blandford, D., Brunstad, R., Gaasland, I., Vårdal, E., Optimal agricultural policy and PSE measurement: An assessment and application to Norway (2010) Journal of International Agricultural Trade and Development, 6 (2), pp. 1-23; Bruinsma, J., (2009), www.fao.org/wsfs/forum2050/wsfs-background-documents/wsfs-expert-papers/en/, The resource outlook to 2050: By how much do land, water and crop yields need to increase by 2050?

Industry concern has resulted in a cooperative pooling of resources among companies, associations and technical organizations. Funded investigative projects have been conducted by capable research organizations employing sophisticated techniques. While useful information has been gained and incorporated into operational procedures, the basic cause remains elusive. A completely different, and additional investigative technique is suggested based on cumulative experience and observation of daily events. This can provide the informational basis to alleviate the safety and liability concerns associated with direct contact between molten aluminum and water. It would facilitate the adaptation of techniques which would greatly enhance the retention of cast shop metal values which are presently lost. Equally important is the major cost impact this can have on the Aluminum Industry as governments begin imposing the `carbon tax' associated with curtailing carbon dioxide emissions related to the `greenhouse effect'.",,"Aluminum industry; Accident prevention; Explosives; Liquid metals; Water; Aluminum castings",,,Conference Paper,Scopus

Results show that a higher price of gasoline shifts vehicle holdings towards more fuel efficient vehicles and reduces the annual demand for miles, whereas imposing a fee on vehicles or a feebate program only shifts vehicle holdings towards more fuel efficient vehicles and has little to no impact on the demand for miles. While it is relatively expensive to reduce CO2 emission through incentive-based policies, achieving any abatement level is more expensive through imposing fees on vehicles than gasoline taxes. In addition, the maximum amount of abatement attainable by a feebate program is relatively small and the same amount could be achieved by imposing a $0.73 gasoline tax per gallon. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Emissions abatement cost functions; Fiscal environmental policy instruments; In-use vehicle emissions","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Crashworthiness; Environmental protection; Gasoline; Vehicles; Abatement costs; Consumer expenditure; Emissions abatement costs; Environmental policy; Fuel-efficient vehicles; Target vehicles; Vehicle emission; Vehicle holding; Cost functions; abatement cost; automobile; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; environmental policy; fiscal policy; transportation policy; United States","Dubin, J.A., McFadden, D.L., An econometric analysis of residential electric appliance holdings and consumption (1984) Econometrica, 52, pp. 345-362; Espey, M., Explaining the variation in elasticity estimates of gasoline demand in the United States: a meta analysis (1996) Energy Journal, 17, pp. 49-60; Feng, Y.D., Fullerton, D., Gan, L., Vehicle Choice, Miles Driven and Pollution Policies (2005) National Bureau of Economic Research, , Working Paper, No. 11553; Fullerton, D., West, S.E., Can taxes on cars and gasoline mimic an unavailable tax on emissions?

Turkish government has been developing several energy policy documents to evaluate how various renewable energy sources of the country can be utilized optimally in the generation of electricity within the next 30 years. This study considers three scenarios in the transition to renewable energy for Turkey; the business as usual (BAU), energy conservation (EC) and renewable energy (REN) scenarios. EC scenario considers the use of energy-efficient appliances and imposing a carbon tax, whereas REN scenario considers increasing the share of the renewable energy sources as much as possible in the power generation mix. These scenarios were evaluated in terms of cost and environmental impact. The LEAP (Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning Model) was used in the research. The REN scenario has been shown to be the optimal energy policy option for Turkey in terms of cost and environmental impact. © 2019 IEEE.","energy efficiency; energy system models; Renewable energy transition","Commerce; Electric power generation; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Environmental impact; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Natural resources; Power markets; Thermoelectric power plants; Comparative studies; Electricity generation capacity; Energy system model; Energy-efficient appliances; Power generation mix; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Thermal power plants; Renewable energy resources","(2016) International Energy Agency, , Energy Policies of IEA Countries Turkey 2016 Review.

First, CO2 emissions from agricultural production activities, farming, and livestock husbandry are computed. Then, this paper explores the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of CO2 emissions and their intensity in China's agricultural sector. Finally, this paper compares decoupling of China's agricultural CO2 emissions from agricultural output value across different regions and years. The results indicate that fertilizer, in-season rice cultivation, and cattle generated the most CO2 emissions in the categories of agricultural production activities, farming, and livestock husbandry, respectively. The results also show that East China covered more periods of the strong decoupling of CO2 emissions from agricultural output value between 1997 and 2014. To decrease CO2 emissions, this paper suggests imposing a higher value-added tax on fertilizer producers, while waiving value-added tax for organic fertilizer and substituting animal manure for conventional fertilizers where possible. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Decoupling; Organic fertilizer","Agriculture; Carbon; Cultivation; Economics; Fertilizers; Agricultural output; Agricultural productions; Agricultural sector; Decoupling; Economic growths; Organic fertilizers; Rice cultivation; Spatial and temporal heterogeneity; Carbon dioxide","Anifowose, B., Odubela, M., Methane emissions from oil and gas transport facilities - exploring innovative ways to mitigate environmental consequences (2015) J. Clean.

The environment-conscious Govt. tries to reduce environmental impacts (EIs) of the green products having different greening levels (environment friendliness). At the same time, Govt. makes an effort to generate some specific Govt. net revenue (GNR) from the SC members. The EIs of the products are accounted for based on the amount of carbon emission which determines the greening level of the products. The GNR is generated from the collected taxes and penalty at the trading price for the extra amount of emissions. The Govt. encourages manufacturers to produce greening products by contributing some subsidy. The investigated SC consists of two competitive manufacturers producing separately one of two substitutable greening products and selling to a common retailer by make-to-order business policy. The retailer sells to the customers against their demands based on the selling prices, indirect taxes and greening levels. We develop non-linear bi-level interactive models between the Govt. and SC members. The Govt. is top-level decision maker collecting taxes from retailer paid by customers and paying subsidy/imposing fine to the manufacturers. At the bottom level, there are SC members. The manufacturers horizontally follow Nash-equilibrium and vertically Stackelberg leader-follower decisions among the manufacturers and retailer or cooperating with each other. Finally, numerical experiments are performed on the models and different decisions are derived under nine scenarios. Sensitivity analyses showing the effects of model parameters are presented. It is observed that whoever becomes the leader, his/her profit is maximum amongst the scenarios and within the scenario, who has the highest demand, he/she dominates. Some managerial insights are also presented. © 2018","Cap-and-trade and tax; Government tariffs; Green supply chain management; Greening products; Stackelberg game; Substitutable products","Commerce;

Paper mills have been started to shut down since 2001, as energy caused was the main matter of concern. The government decided to raise taxes by imposing the Climate Change Levy of 0.43 per kw on electricity, and 0.15 per kw on gas. As a result the mills started to invest in new technology to save energy and produce less carbon dioxide. The mills stopped using surplus waste papers brought about by the closure of the mill, without adding any value. The papers were exported back in order to import more finished products, and resulted in closure of the paper mills. Some of the other causes of global warming is argued to be the replacement and removal of the broad leaf trees in the tropics to prevent the continuing slash and burn policy to make space for beef farms.",,"Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Electricity; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Plant shutdowns; Waste paper; Broad leaf trees; Finished products; Slash and burn policy; Paper and pulp industry; Energy Conservation; Paper Industry; Paper Mills; Waste Papers",,,Article,Scopus

Some regulators encourage the firms to remanufacture, and the others levy environmental tax (such as carbon tax) to make the firms internalize environmental cost. Thus, the effect of incorporating the taxation on remanufactured products on the world needs to be examined. This paper mainly explores the situations where incorporating tax on remanufactured products may not make the world better in the context of triple bottom line thinking (namely, economic, environment, and social welfare). Using a Stackelberg game model for two cases with and without tax on remanufactured products, we first characterize the optimal solutions for the manufacturer and analyze the effects of imposing tax on remanufactured products on production, economy, and environment. Our analysis shows that incorporating the tax on remanufactured products can mitigate the cannibalization of remanufactured products and promote the demand for new products in low tax interval. If the tax price is low and consumers consider that the remanufactured product is environment-friendly enough, incorporating the tax on remanufactured products brings a 'lose-lose' situation where the economic and environmental performances of the manufacturer are simultaneously damaged. This warns the regulators that there is no need to impose tax on remanufactured products when the environmental awareness of consumers is strong enough under the low-tax price. From the social welfare perspective, we determine the optimal tax price level and discuss the situation where incorporating tax on remanufactured products makes the welfare worse. © 2013 IEEE.","Cannibalization; environmental regulation; remanufactured product; triple bottom line","Analytical models; Economics; Environmental management; Environmental regulations; Finance; Recycling; Supply chains; Cannibalization; Economic and environmental performance; Environment friendly; Environmental awareness; Government; Materials extraction; Remanufactured products; Triple Bottom Line; Taxation","Kleindorfer, P.R., Singhal, K., Van Wassenhove, L.N., Sustainable operations management (2005) Prod.

Firstly, the article dismisses the view that there is deep division over predictions of the future climate, and highlights the broad agreement in the scientific community that emissions of CO2, CH4, CFCs, and NOx will enhance the greenhouse effect, which will result on average in an additional warming of the Earth's surface. Scientists predict an average temperature rise of between 2°C and 5°C before the end of the next century, causing sea level to rise from 30cm to as much as 1m, causing severe damage to low-lying regions. Secondly, the costs and disruption incurred by tackling global warming will not be as great as many people believe, in fact, the countries which have achieved the most in energy efficiency improvements have also been the most economically successful. Thirdly, the author examines the contribution of the less developed countries to greenhouse gas emissions in the future, and suggests that, by following less polluting pathways, they could avoid the inefficient, dirty technologies of the developed world. This, however, will require large initial investments in new technologies for these countries by the industrialised world, for which funds could be raised by imposing a carbon tax, of just US$1 per barrel of oil, as suggested by Goldemberg of Brazil. In conclusion, Canada's present environmental position is discussed, and recommendations are made for the future. -M.Z.Barber",,"climate change; climatic change; cost; emission; global warming; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; pollution problem",,,Article,Scopus

Biomass is a promising resource and it can be converted to multiple products and services including fuels, chemicals, heat and electricity via different conversion routes. Hence, replacement of fossil-based services with biomass-based services is critical to mitigate fossil CO2 emissions, and innovative design of new and efficient energy conversion systems is necessary. Different industries need heat for their operations at different temperature levels. Today, these demands are satisfied using conventional natural gas boilers by imposing a CO2 tax to account for their emissions. In this study, we discuss the potential of replacing conventional boilers with a combined heat and fuel (CHF) plant design which utilizes lignocellulosic biomass in thermochemical conversion to generate heat for different industrial sectors together with biofuels cogeneration. Heat is generated due to the exothermic nature of the thermochemical conversion processes that operate at high temperatures. Gasification process produces syngas which is converted into fuels such as synthetic natural gas, Fischer-Tropsch crude, methanol and dimethyl ether and electricity. Different scenarios are evaluated considering the CO2 produced via this system is either released, sequestrated, or stored and used in a co-electrolysis unit in which surplus renewable electricity available during summer is converted into additional syngas. A parametric analysis has been performed considering type and size of plants, CO2 tax, and purchase and transportation costs of wood to compare the price of heat for the industrial sectors. Natural gas and wood boilers are used as the basis to calculate the breakeven CO2 tax values for the same heat prices for the proposed CHF systems. The results of this study present a state-of-the-art renewable energy system as an alternative to conventional boilers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass gasification; Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS); Combined Heat and Fuel (CHF) plant; Industrial process heat demand; Power-to-Gas (P2G); Process integration","Biofuels; Biomass; Boilers; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Cellulosic ethanol; Costs; Electrolysis; Energy conversion; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Gasification; Methanol fuels; Natural gas; Synthesis gas; Biomass Gasification; Carbon capture and sequestrations; Combined heat; Industrial process heat; Power-to-Gas (P2G); Process integration; Natural gasoline plants","Andersson, E., Harvey, S., Comparison of pulp-mill-integrated hydrogen production from gasified black liquor with stand-alone production from gasified biomass (2007) Energy, 32 (4), pp. 399-405. , <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544206001575>; Arvidsson, M., Heyne, S., Morandin, M., Harvey, S., Integration opportunities for substitute natural gas (sng) production in an industrial process plant (2012) Chem.

To date, gasoline demand elasticity estimates are almost exclusively based on aggregate data that are subject to aggregation problems and make distributional concerns impossible to address. By using household-level data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and imputed fuel efficiency measures and gasoline prices, I estimate household demand for gasoline and the corresponding price and income demand elasticities. An attempt is made to include data on the car stock in the estimation since car-portfolio and gasoline demand decisions are closely related. Empirical results from a selection corrected gasoline demand regression suggest low short-run price and income elasticities and clear differences in gasoline demand across the population. These results suggest that a gasoline tax is not likely to result in large decreases in gasoline consumption while potentially imposing hardship on identifiable segments of the population.

It considers the case where a set of heterogeneous trucks is used for transporting products, and develops a mathematical model that coordinates the supply chain. The purpose of this paper is to minimise the costs of producing and delivering a product as well as carbon emissions resulting from transportation. In addition, the authors analyse how imposing a tax on carbon emissions impacts the delivery of products from the suppliers to the buyer. Design/methodology/approach - It is assumed that heterogeneous vehicles are used for transporting products, which have different performance and cost attributes. A mathematical model that considers both operating costs and carbon emissions from transportation is developed. The impact of vehicle attributes on lot sizing and routing decisions is studied with the help of numerical examples and a sensitivity analysis. Findings - The analysis shows that considering carbon emissions in coordinating a supply chain leads to changes in the routing of vehicles. It is further shown that if carbon emissions lead to costs, routes are changed in such a way that vehicles travel long distances empty or with a low vehicle load to reduce fuel consumption and therewith emissions. Research limitations/implications - Several areas for future work are highlighted. The study of alternative supply chain structures, for example structures which include logistics service providers, or the investigation of different functional relationships between vehicle load and emission generation offer possibilities for extending the model. Originality/value - The paper is one of the first to study the use of heterogeneous vehicles in an inventory model of a supply chain, and one of the few supply chain inventory models that consider ecological aspects. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Heterogeneous vehicles; Inventory; Inventory decisions; Inventory management; Supply chain management",,"Abdallah, T., Diabat, A., Simchi-Levi, D., A carbon sensitive supply chain network problem with green procurement (2010) Proceedings of the 40th International Conference on Computers and Industrial Engineering, pp. 1-6. , Awaji; Absi, N., Dauzère-Pérès, S., Kedad-Sidhoum, S., Penz, B., Rapine, C., Lot sizing with carbon emission constraints (2013) European Journal of Operational Research, 227 (1), pp. 55-61; Banerjee, A., A joint economic lot size model for purchaser and vendor (1986) Decision Sciences, 17 (3), pp. 292-311; Bektas, T., Laporte, G., The pollution-routing problem (2011) Transportation Research Part B, 45 (8), pp. 1232-1250; Benjaafar, S., Li, Y., Daskin, M., Carbon footprint and the management of supply chains: Insights from simple models (2012) IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, 10 (1), pp. 99-116; Chaabane, A., Ramudhin, A., Paquet, M., Design of sustainable supply chains under the emission trading scheme (2012) International Journal of Production Economics, 135 (1), pp. 37-49; Cholette, S., Venkat, K., The energy and carbon intensity of wine distribution: A study of logistical options for delivering wine to consumers (2009) Journal of Cleaner Production, 17 (16), pp. 1401-1413; Dantzig, G.B., Ramser, J.H., The truck dispatching problem (1959) Management Science, 6 (1), pp. 80-91; Demir, E., Bektas, T., Laporte, G., The bi-objective pollution-routing problem (2014) European Journal of Operational Research, 232 (3), pp. 464-478; Dessouky, M., Rahimi, M., Wediner, M., Jointly optimizing cost, service, and environmental performance in demand-responsive transit scheduling (2003) Transportation Research Part D, 8 (6), pp. 433-465; Diabat, A., Simchi-Levi, D., A carbon-capped supply chain network problem (2009) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management, pp. 523-527. , Hong Kong; Dong, C., Shen, B., Chow, P.-S., Yang, L., Ng, C.T., Sustainability investment under cap-and-trade regulation Annals of Operations Research, , (in press); Egenhofer, C., The making of the EU emission trading scheme: Status, prospects and implications for business (2007) European Management Journal, 25 (6), pp. 453-463; Eglese, R., Black, D., Optimizing the routeing of vehicles (2010) Green Logistics, pp. 222-235. , McKinnon, A., Browne, M. and Whiteing, A.

The understanding is growing that a full turn-over of the electricity sectors by 2050 is an elementary condition for avoiding global average temperature increase beyond 2 °C. This article adopts such full transition as Europe's target when designing renewable energy policy. An immediate corollary is that phasing-in unprecedented energy efficiency and renewable generation must be paralleled by phasing-out non-sustainable fossil fuel and nuclear power technologies. The double phasing programme assigns novel meaning to nearby target settings for renewable power as share of total power consumption. It requires organizing in the medium term EU-wide markets for green power, a highly demanding task in the present context of poorly functional markets in brown power. The EU Commission's 2007/2008 proposals of expanding tradable certificates markets were not based on solid analysis of past experiences and future necessities. The keystone of sound policies on renewable electricity development is a detailed scientific differentiation and qualification of renewable electricity sources and technologies, for measuring the huge diversity in the field. We provide but structuring concepts about such qualification, because implementation requires extensive research resources. Support for renewable electricity development is organized via feed-in prices or premiums, and via quota obligations connected to tradable green certificates. Green certificates are dependent on physical generated renewable power, but separable and no joint products. Contrary to conventional wisdom we argue their separation in cost analysis but firm linking during trade. A few graphs illustrate the importance of assigning qualities to different renewable power sources/technologies. Feed-in systems based on an acceptable qualification perform generally better than certificate markets imposing uniform approaches on a very diverse reality. For a similar reason, uniform and undifferentiated taxation of non-sustainable energy sources cannot replace renewable energy support schemes capable of differentiation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) and volumetric tax credits for biofuels seek to supplement the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and provide incentives for producing and blending cellulosic biofuels. This Article examines the effects of these policies on the mix of biofuels produced, food and fuel prices, and consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as compared to the RFS alone. It also examines the effects of two performance-based policies that target incentives based on the GHG intensity of fuels. This Article finds that the BCAP and volumetric tax credits together lead to biofuel production that exceeds the minimum required by the RFS by 26% and to a significant transition away from corn ethanol and toward cellulosic bio-fuels. They also reduce GHG emissions by 3% and gasoline consumption by 100 billion liters relative to the level with the RFS alone. These subsidy policies are costly for the government and for the economy, however, imposing a welfare cost of $122 billion over the 2007-2022 period. Replacing these payments by subsidies based on carbon credits generated by a feedstock relative to gasoline, though less costly, does not create significant incentives to change the mix of biofuels beyond the levels mandated by the RFS. In contrast to these subsidy policies, supplementing the RFS with a $30 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions carbon price instrument is found to achieve the 3% reduction in GHG emissions with a gain in social welfare and lower costs to the government relative to the RFS alone.",,,"Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, , Pub.

The model was developed as a minimum cost diet model. Two types of environmental policies were examined: a tax and a constraint on methane emissions. A tax was incorporated to simulate a greenhouse gas emissions tax policy, and prices of carbon credits in the current carbon markets were attributed to the methane production variable. Three independent runs were made, using carbon dioxide equivalent prices of $5, $17, and $250/t. A constraint was incorporated into the model to simulate the second type of environmental policy, reducing methane emissions by predetermined amounts. The linear programming formulation of this second alternative enabled the calculation of marginal costs of reducing methane emissions. Methane emission and manure production by dairy cows were calculated according to published equations, and nitrogen and mineral excretions were calculated by mass conservation laws. Results were compared with respect to the values generated by a base least-cost model. Current prices of the carbon credit market did not appear onerous enough to have a substantive incentive effect in reducing methane emissions and altering diet costs of our hypothetical dairy herd. However, when emissions of methane were assumed to be reduced by 5, 10, and 13.5% from the base model, total diet costs increased by 5, 19.1, and 48.5%, respectively. Either these increased costs would be passed onto the consumer or dairy producers would go out of business. Nitrogen and potassium excretions were increased by 16.5 and 16.7% with a 13.5% reduction in methane emissions from the base model. Imposing methane restrictions would further increase the demand for grains and other human-edible crops, which is not a progressive solution for an industry trying to be sustainable. However, these results might depend on the constraints and inputs used in our model (e.g., feed prices), and more extensive analyses are required before they are used in policy development. The model structure was able to incorporate effects of environmental policies in diet formulation and it can assist dairy producers in meeting limits set by these policies. The model can also assist policy makers examining the effects of policies on the dairy production system. © 2012 American Dairy Science Association.","Diet formulation; Environment; Linear programming; Policy","methane; animal; animal disease; animal food; article; cattle; cost; dairying; diet; economics; environmental planning; female; methodology; physiology; statistical model; Animal Feed; Animals; Cattle; Costs and Cost Analysis; Dairying; Diet; Environmental Policy; Female; Linear Models; Methane","(1993) Energy and Protein Requirements of Ruminants, , Agricultural and Food Research Council (AFRC), CAB International, Wallingford, UK; Beever, D.E., Cammell, S.B., Sutton, J.D., Spooner, M.C., Haines, M.J., Harland, J.I., The effect of concentrate type on energy utilization in lactating cows (1989) Proc. 11th Symp.

This paper takes the inter-city passenger transport in China as a case, and develops a system dynamics model for policy assessment and CO2 mitigation potential analysis. It is found that the future demand for China's inter-city passenger transport is expected to be large, with the turnover volume growing at a rate of 9% per annum and amounting to 6600 billion p-km in 2020. Major emissions reduction potential exists in inter-city passenger transport. In 2020, comparing to the case without any specific policies stressing mitigation, the reduction of CO2 emissions ranges from 26% to 32% under those scenarios with policy controls. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the CO2 mitigation will be best achieved by accelerating the development of railway network, together with slowing down the extension of highway network and imposing fuel taxes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent years, concerns about the effects those emissions might have on the climate have prompted the Congress, federal regulators, and others to consider policies to reduce them. This Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report examines the unintended effects on the competitiveness of U.S firms of an economywide policy, such as a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade program, that would reduce emissions by imposing a price on them. The report also assesses the use of border adjustments, such as import tariffs and export subsidies, and transition assistance to mitigate those unintended effects. Border adjustments could reduce the loss of competitiveness and make the costs of U.S. producers more similar to those of producers in countries that do not impose comparable policies, but such adjustments could be difficult to implement and to defend if challenged as being inconsistent with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), one of the component agreements of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Transition assistance could also offset the loss of competitiveness and would probably be easier to implement but might engender difficulties under WTO agreements as well. © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Confronted with such evidence, the European Union set in late 2006 an ambitious target to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, by 2020, to 20% below the level of 1990; and invited the rest of the developed economies and the developing world to take part with the Kyoto Protocol. Turkey is the only country that appears in the Annex-I list of the United Nations' Rio Summit and yet an official target for CO2 emission reductions has still not been established. Thus, as part of its accession negotiations with the EU, Turkey will likely to face significant pressures to introduce its national plan on climate change along with specific emission targets and the associated abatement policies. Given this motivation, we utilize a computable general equilibrium model for Turkey to study the economic impacts of the intended policy scenarios of compliance with the Kyoto Protocol and we report on the general equilibrium effects of various possible environmental abatement policies in Turkey over the period 2006-2020. The model is in the Walrasian tradition with 10 production sectors and a government operating within an open macroeconomy environment. It accommodates flexible production functions, imperfect substitution in trade and open unemployment. We focus on CO2 emissions and distinguish various basic sources of gaseous pollution in the model. Our results suggest that the burden of imposing emission control targets and the implied abatement costs could be quite high, and that there is a need to finance the expanded abatement investments from scarce domestic resources. Policies for environmental abatement via carbon and/or increased energy taxes further suffer from very adverse employment effects. This suggests that a first-best policy would necessarily call for a simultaneous reduction on the existing tax burden on producers elsewhere together with introduction of environmental taxes. © 2007 Society for Policy Modeling.","Climate change; Environmental policy; General equilibrium; Global warming",,"Adkins, L.G., Garbaccio, R.F., (1999) A bibliography of CGE models applied to environmental issues, , US Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Policy, Office of Economy and Environment, Mimeo; Agénor, P.R., Jensen, H.T., Verghis, M., Yeldan, E., Disinflation, fiscal sustainability, and labor market adjustment in Turkey (Chapter 7) (2007) Adjustment policies, poverty and unemployment: The IMMPA framework, , Richard A., Izquierdo A., and Jensen H.T.

Most notably, the National Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing Commission, after extensive review of existing studies and conducting its own research, recommended that the US transition to a user-charge system such as a vehicle-miles-traveled system.1 Some US states have already conducted studies with alternative funding mechanisms.2 For example, Oregon has conducted two pilot studies on roaduser fees. One study conducted in 2006-2007 found that a mileage fee could be implemented to replace the gas tax as the principal revenue source for road funding.3 A second pilot project conducted in 2012 found further evidence of the viability of a road usage charge administered by private-sector vendors using an easy-to-use mileage reporting and payment system.4 Oregon is moving forward with a mileage collection system starting July 1, 2015, for five thousand volunteer motorists; the state plans to assess a charge of 1.5 cents per mile and issue a gasoline tax refund to participants.5 This report on the road infrastructure funding practices of foreign countries provides an opportunity to determine whether lessons can be learned from the experiences of other countries in funding roads and highways. The individual country surveys reveal a multiplicity of approaches to the funding of road infrastructure. Several of the surveyed countries, like the US, have a fuel tax that is dedicated, at least in part, to the financing of road construction and maintenance. These include Brazil, Canada, China, Israel, and South Africa. Other countries place fuel and other excise taxes with general revenues and fund roads from general revenues, including Australia, England, Germany, Italy, and Mexico. Japan used to dedicate fuel and vehicle taxes to road infrastructure, but began placing such revenues into the general account in fiscal year 2009. Several of the countries appear to rely somewhat heavily on private roads, concessions, or private-public partnerships as means to fund some of their road infrastructure, including Canada, China, France, Israel, and South Africa. In Australia, some state governments have developed networks of toll roads in partnership with private-sector investors, and the present Australian government is currently evaluating possible mechanisms for maximizing private-sector investment in major infrastructure projects. Most of the surveyed countries have tolling systems to obtain part of their revenue for financing roads. In the case of Japan and France, the surveys note that tolls are linked with the weight of the vehicle and distance traveled. In the Netherlands, tolls known as ""mobility rates"" are charged for the use of roads as cars enter fee-payment gateways. In England, a congestion tax is imposed on vehicles that enter central London during certain hours. Efforts to spread the congestion tax to other cities in England and Wales were abandoned, however. A congestion tax is also imposed in Sweden, in the cities of Stockholm and Gothenburg. This tax is not used for road maintenance; its purpose is to shift the preferred means of transportation from cars to public transportation, and to pay for the environmental effects of motor vehicle use. Australia imposes a fuel-based, road-user charge on heavy trucks based on the amount of fuel used. A reform advisory group has proposed that trucks should be required to have GPS devices installed to enable taxation on the basis of distance traveled, and has argued that there should be a stronger relationship between revenues from user charges and the provision of the road network. In France, the government was planning this year to implement a tax on heavy trucks that would have contributed to the financing of transportation infrastructure, which would have been calculated on a per-kilometer basis and on the basis of the vehicle's size, age, and level of emissions. The implementation of this tax has been postponed, perhaps until 2015, because of strong public opposition. Sweden taxes motor vehicles to pay for costs associated with them, including carbon dioxide emissions and road maintenance. The Netherlands imposes a motor vehicle tax based on the vehicle's carbon dioxide emission level. Italy similarly imposes a vehicle tax based in part on the amount of pollution generated by the vehicle. The Netherlands government in 2009 considered imposing a per-kilometer fee for motor vehicle use and abolishing the motor vehicle tax, but that scheme was never instituted. In England, the prospect of a national system of road pricing based on usage was raised by a Transport Minister in 2012, but no legislation has been proposed. In Sweden, a December 2013 government report discussing possible changes to the taxation of motor vehicles proposed a new tax on heavy-duty vehicles based on kilometers driven. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

How can they be persuaded to curb the waste they make, to decrease the air and water pollution they generate, to throw away less waste or to reduce their carbon footprint? Should government policy-makers rely upon people’s sense of social responsibility or their feelings of public duty to behave appropriately? Should governments simply supply individuals and households with information about the environmental cost of their activities? Explicitly appeal to a sense of public duty through exhortation and entreaty? Or should they go in a different direction, give up on notions of social responsibility and public duty, and instead try to regulate in some way those activities with an adverse impact on the environment? If so, in what way? Through imposing bans or other forms of legal restrictions on those activities – or through creating a financial incentive to reduce the activities by imposing a charge or tax on them, or on the waste they generate? The answer to these questions will in part depend upon the answers to a further set of questions concerning the structure of individual motivation. Should individuals be regarded as essentially public-spirited with respect to the environment, committed to promoting the welfare of their fellow citizens and the wider society through economizing on the damage they do: socially responsible ‘knights’, in terms of a metaphor one of us has used elsewhere (Le Grand, 2006)? In which case, the provision of the relevant information, perhaps coupled with some exhortation to remind people of their social duty, should be sufficient to change their environmentally damaging behaviour. Or should people be treated as primarily self-interested agents, indifferent to those negatively affected by their waste products and only responsive to incentives that directly affect (either positively or negatively) their own personal interests: not knights, but something closer to those whom David Hume (among others) termed ‘knaves’? In which case, the government will need to use policy methods that appeal to people’s sense of self-interest (or self-preservation), such as charges, taxation, subsidies or direct regulation. © Cambridge University Press 2013.",,,"Bandura, A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change (1977) Psychology Review, 84 (2), pp. 191-215; Irish bag tax hailed success (2002) BBC News, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2205419.stm#, accessed 10 November 2007; Chief executive of tesco on how the scheme will work (2006) BBC News, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5244708.stm, accessed 4 August 2006; Brogan, B., Gordon brown gives supermarkets one year to start charging for plastic bags … or else (2008) Daily Mail, , www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-522765/Gordon-Brown-gives-supermarkets-year-start-charging-plastic-bags-else.html, accessed 29 February 2008; De Charms, R., (1968) Personal Causation: The Internal Affective Determinants of Behavior, , New York: Academic Press; De Young, R., Some psychological aspects of reduced consumption behavior: The role of intrinsic satisfaction and competence motivation (1996) Environment and Behavior, 28 (3), pp. 358-409; Deci, E.L., Eghrari, H., Patrick, B., Leone, D., Facilitating internalization: The self-determination theory perspective (1994) Journal of Personality, 62 (1), pp. 120-142; Deci, E.L., Ryan, R., The ‘what’ and ‘why’ of goal pursuits: Human needs and the self-determination of behavior (2000) Psychological Inquiry, 11 (4), pp. 227-268; Dee, J., Barclay, V., (2005) Plastic Check-Out Bag Use in Non-Supermarket Retail Outlets, , www.environment.gov.au/archive/settlements/publications/waste/plastic-bags/planet-ark/pubs/planet-ark.pdf, Australian Government: Department of Environment, Waste, Heritage and the Arts, accessed November 2007; (2006) Local Environmental Quality: Plastic Bags, , www.defra.gov.uk/environment/localenv/litter/bags/index.htm, accessed 30 March 2007; (2002) Plastic Shopping Bags - Analysis of Levies and Environmental Impacts: Final Report, , www.environment.gov.au/settlements/publications/waste/plastic-bags/pubs/analysis.pdf, Prepared in association with RMIT Centre for Design and Eunomia Research and Consulting Ltd, accessed 5 November 2007; Fiorillo, D., Do monetary rewards undermine intrinsic motivations of volunteers?
